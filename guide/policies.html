<h1>1.4. Grading Rubric<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-rubric" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Everybody is assumed to start with an <strong>A</strong> in the course.  If you do the work
you will keep it, but failing to fulfill the expectations will cause you to
drift downward.</p>
<p>Grading for this course is based on frequent low-stakes assessment.  Each
assignment is graded on one or more of the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>concept</strong>: clarity of the key idea, articulation of key principles and
narrative, applicability to human or artistic needs, selection of appropriate
aspects for proof-of-concept.</li>
<li><strong>execution</strong>: translation of the concept into design, quality of the
technical implementation.</li>
<li><strong>documentation</strong>: quality of the reflection, clarity of the presentation,
detail of the technical documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each applicable criterion is rated on a two point scale as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>0</strong>: incomplete: does not satisfy objectives</li>
<li><strong>1</strong>: satisfactory: answers the prompt</li>
<li><strong>2</strong>: outstanding: surprises, shows deep insight</li>
</ul>
<p>Full project reports will utilize all three criteria and be graded on a scale of
0-6, comprising two points each for concept, execution, and documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that the typical successful score will be a three, not a six; this
is best regarded as a pass/fail score for each of the three criteria with the
possibility for bonus points.</p>
<p>Please note that project deadlines are strict as outlined in the <a class="reference internal" href="#id2">Lateness
Policy</a> section.</p>
<p>Project reports must also adhere carefully to the requirements specified in the
<a class="reference internal" href="assignments.html#project-report-requirements"><span>Project Reports</span></a> section in order to achieve full documentation
scores.</p>
<p>The total course grades are scored on a relative scale based on weighted point
totals.  The approximate total weighting is 60% for projects, 30% for exercises,
and 10% for other.  The full grade includes many categories:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>group project proposals</li>
<li>group project milestones</li>
<li>group project reports documenting full projects</li>
<li>ideation exercises</li>
<li>reviews of lab notebooks documenting technical exercises</li>
<li>brief individual topical lectures</li>
<li>individual peer-evaluation reports</li>
<li>skills survey</li>
<li>individual interviews</li>
<li>attendance</li>
</ol>
<p>Grades provide only a rough metric for student feedback.  The more nuanced and
useful feedback comes from in-class verbal critiques, individual interviews, and
written comments.</p>
<div class="section" id="in-class-project-reviews">
<h2>1.4.1. In-Class Project Reviews<a class="headerlink" href="#in-class-project-reviews" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Several class days will be devoted to in-class demonstration and critique,
including commentary from peers, instructors, and guest experts.  Given the size
of the class we must keep a rigid schedule during these reviews.  Each group
will be expected to make a brief 2-3 minute verbal presentation of their goals
and results, followed by an open question and critique period.  Successful
presentation in such a concise form depends on planning; students are expected
to prepare and rehearse their explanations.</p>
<p>The in-class presentation and critique of projects serves several purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>provides a live performance or demonstration for evaluation</li>
<li>demonstrates your ability to speak succintly about your ideas</li>
<li>provides the primary opportunity for your peers to see and comment on your work</li>
</ul>
<p>Please prepare for the critique as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Please be prepared to give a brief (typically 2 minute) verbal overview of
your idea and execution.  Please rehearse this explanation ahead of time.</li>
<li>Please be prepared to demonstrate or perform at your designated time.  Please
rehearse your performance ahead of time.</li>
<li>For the project artifacts and performance, the overall emphasis is on
proof-of-concept rather than fit and finish.  Please be prepared to designate
what issues were deliberately set aside and which were explored to guide the
critique.  But please be prepared to justify this choice in light of the
overall concept.</li>
<li>In-class critique may still consider all features in relation to their
support of the concept, especially when guest instructors are present.  When
this happens, please consider this an exploration of your idea that goes
beyond the graded evaluation.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interviews">
<h2>1.4.2. Interviews<a class="headerlink" href="#interviews" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The course includes students with widely varying experience and highly
individual learning goals.  In order to clarify individual goals and
expectations, there will be three private out-of-class interviews with each
individual student, held near the beginning, midpoint, and end of the semester.
Students will be prompted in advance in order to prepare statements of their
objectives, progress, or achievements for each interview stage.  This is not a
graded exercise but a means of providing individual feedback.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-reports">
<h2>1.4.3. Project Reports<a class="headerlink" href="#project-reports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each assignment serves both learning and evaluative goals.  Fulfilling the
assignment is an essential step in the learning process, and the result also
demonstrates learning success.  Please take careful note of the requirements
each assignment: they represent a contract between student and instructor.</p>
<p>The objective of assigning reports is to encourage evaluative thinking
throughout the process of development.  Writing and sketching is much faster
than physically building something, and writing the core of the report <em>first</em>
is a great way to clarify a concept.  It is highly recommended to consider the
report requirements throughout your process, e.g., by taking in-process notes
and photos, and fully drawing out designs.  For full project reports, please be
careful to observe the detailed specifications listed in <a class="reference internal" href="assignments.html#project-report-requirements"><span>Project Reports</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="written-feedback">
<h2>1.4.4. Written Feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#written-feedback" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The counterpart to the strict submission deadlines is a committment from the
instructor to provide timely written feedback within one week of each
deadline.  This provides an opportunity for constructive critique to be
applied immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-gallery">
<h2>1.4.5. Project Gallery<a class="headerlink" href="#project-gallery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Projects of merit may be requested to provide a public version of their project
documentation for the <a class="reference external" href="http://ideate.xsead.cmu.edu/gallery/">IDeATe project gallery</a>.  This will not be required or
graded, but represents an opportunity to have your work publicly presented as
part of the IDeATe portfolio and should need only minimal additional effort to
prepare.</p>

<div class="section" id="general-course-policies">
<h1>1.5. General Course Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#general-course-policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="attendance-policy">
<h2>1.5.1. Attendance Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#attendance-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Coming to class is important: don&#8217;t be absent.  I understand that the hour is
early and your other courses have big deadlines, but the designated class hours
are the most effective time for communicating among group members and
instructors.</p>
<p>Attendance will be recorded for each class period and your record will be
considered during final grading.  Unexcused absences during review days will
reduce your individual project grades.</p>

<div class="section" id="lateness-policy">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>1.5.3. Lateness Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#lateness-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All assignments must be submitted by the required deadline, unless prior
authorization is obtained from an instructor and documented in email.  Verbal
authorization is <em>not</em> sufficient: any verbal discussion of late submission must
be documented with an emailed request and reply.</p>
<p>Assignments received within 24 hours of the deadline will receive half-score.
Assignments received later than 24 hours will not be examined and receive zero
score.</p>
<p>Assignments bounced for revision at the discretion of the instructor must be
returned within 24 hours if not otherwise specified.  This rule is meant to
allow a grace period for reports which overlook a required element; please do
not assume that incomplete work can be resubmitted.</p>
<p>However, please remember that <em>something is always better than nothing</em>.  If the
deadline is imminent, please submit whatever text, images, and drawings you can
rather than do nothing.</p>
<p>And please also note that I understand you have other major deadlines,
so extensions will be forgiving.   <em>Always ask for an extension rather
than silently fail to deliver.</em></p>
