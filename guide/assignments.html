</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-notebook">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>2.9. Lab Notebook<a class="headerlink" href="#lab-notebook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each student is required to keep a personal record of the technical lab
exercises they complete.  We will call this the &#8216;lab notebook&#8217;, although the
physical format is up to the student as long as it meets deliverable
requirements.</p>
<p>There are several checkpoints in the semester when your instructor will examine
your documents.  The first deadline is early (Notebook 1A) just so we have a
chance to clear up any misunderstanding about expectations.  The others occur at
the end of each unit (Notebook 1B,2,3).</p>
<p>The main purposes for requiring you to keep a record of your lab exercises are
prompting reflection and documenting your progress.  We also hope it may form a
personal reference guide to the techniques you learn which may help you when
working on projects.</p>
<p><strong>Prompting Reflection.</strong> Learning isn&#8217;t just about doing, it&#8217;s about
<em>integrating</em> new experience into knowledge by <em>reflecting</em> on the process.
Each lab notebook entry should answer <strong>one or more</strong> of the following prompts in a
concise sentence or two:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>What did I learn?</li>
<li>What do you think the instructor intended you to learn?</li>
<li>What was the most surprising outcome?</li>
<li>How specifically will this help me achieve my goals?</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Think in terms of an <strong>articulable principle</strong> which you could teach to others.</p>
<p><strong>Documenting Progress.</strong> If your instructors and peers can see what you&#8217;ve done
they may be able to point out details or suggest alternatives.  The minimum
requirements for documentation are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Note the name of the exercise.</li>
<li>Note the date and time of completion.</li>
<li>List any partner(s).  You will work with many different partners; you may
share material or write a notebook entry collaboratively, but each student
should include a copy of the entry in your individual notebook.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It may also be useful to include a meaningful photograph or sketches.  Video
can be handy for your own reference, but in order to keep grading review
manageable your videos may or not be examined by the instructor.  If you include
video, please upload them to a server and note the URL.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Prompts.</strong>  Here are other suggested questions to consider when completing exercises.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Did the process fail in an interesting way?</li>
<li>Was there a particular problem which caused a seemingly disproportionate
effort or time to overcome?</li>
<li>Is there an error in the exercise text? (If so, please check the
<a class="reference internal" href="errata.html#errata"><span>Errata</span></a> first then consider reporting it.)</li>
<li>How could the exercise be improved?</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Physical Format.</strong> The notebook may be kept in either a physical or digital
form.  There are advantages to each: it is fast and easy to sketch on paper,
but digital can be duplicated more easily for submission.  Here are some suggestions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Use a physical notebook, one page per exercise.  At each checkpoint, turn
it in to your instructor. (You&#8217;ll lose it for a few days.)</li>
<li>If you can&#8217;t stand giving it up, use a physical notebook or loose-leaf
binder, one page per exercise, and submit <strong>stapled</strong> photocopies.</li>
<li>If you prefer to type (or want to include a lot of links), write it up as a
single document file, one section per exercise.  <strong>PDF, plain text, or
HTML</strong> is greatly preferred over proprietary file formats (e.g. .doc, .docx,
Illustrator, .fzz, etc.)  If you need to include photos separately, bundle
the document and photos into a single .zip file.</li>
<li>Whatever you do, please consider that your instructor will need to skim
through 25 of these and make comments, so please keep it legible, organized,
and concise.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="research-talk">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>2.10. Research Talk<a class="headerlink" href="#research-talk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each student is required to give a five-minute research talk on a topic of their
choosing.  The short length is actually a challenge, it requires careful
attention to developing and practicing a clear delivery of a few key ideas.
This assignment provides practice in technical speaking and will serve to bring
additional ideas into our discussion.</p>
<p>The topic may be chosen in one of several ways:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Describe an existing project involving physical computing that was developed
elsewhere.</li>
<li>Present a synopsis of a published research paper of interest to physical
computing.</li>
<li>Research and teach a documented analytic or design technique (which must be
new to you).</li>
</ol>
<p>Please see <a class="reference internal" href="related_work.html#related-work"><span>Related Work</span></a> for starting points for finding sources to
research.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this talk is to teach a single concrete idea to your
fellow students.  It shouldn&#8217;t just be an vague invitation for them to go read
the material; it should identify a specific lesson learned and be organized
around teaching that. Here are some prompt questions which may help you plan:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>What was the problem the paper is addressing?</li>
<li>Why is it important?  What is the context?</li>
<li>What new insight was involved in the solution?</li>
<li>How well did it work?</li>
<li>What is the one key takeaway lesson?</li>
<li>Is there a way your peers could apply this solution?</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In general, please focus on the thought process of the <em>author</em>, not your own
reflections.  I.e., it isn&#8217;t that helpful for your audience to hear about your
personal reactions; once they hear the idea themselves they will have naturally
have their own response, but a fair assessment requires a fair hearing.</p>
<p>Talks of this nature are usually accompanied by slides which show visual content
which reinforces the explanation.  Please refrain from plunking down lots of
bullet-point text to read; we would prefer to hear your explanations verbally.
Instead, please consider the available photographs, drawings, diagrams, or
equations.  Due to the short nature of the talk, video clips are not recommended
unless extremely short.</p>
<p>In order to expedite quick transitions from talk to talk, it is <em>highly
recommended</em> that you place your presentation materials online in a format you
can quickly access in-place or download so we may use one shared cluster Mac
connected to the projector.  Please arrive a few minutes early on the day of
your presentation to get your materials in place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ideation-1">
<span id="ideation-exercise-1"></span><h2>2.11. Ideation Exercise 1<a class="headerlink" href="#ideation-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first ideation exercise is intended to generate and share an abundance of
potential project ideas related to physical computing.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Please consider all the themes we will be exploring through physical
computing: human needs for expression, communication, life support, and
pleasure; embodiment, measurement, time, signals, and algorithm; and the
nature of processes which flow from physical to digital forms and back.</li>
<li><strong>Come up with fifty ideas for projects which address the themes above.</strong>  When
devising ideas, consider holding back your presumptions about what is or is
not possible technically: at this stage we encourage broad, unbounded
thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Bring your ideas to class on a physical printout following these rules</strong>:<ul>
<li>all ideas on a single 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221; piece of paper</li>
<li>one line per idea</li>
<li>number the lines</li>
<li>leave a 2-inch margin on the left hand side</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Submit a PDF version</strong> of your single page as a response to the Blackboard
assignment.  <strong>Only PDF will be accepted</strong>: do not submit document files such
as .doc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The physical format is very important as we will be passing around and reviewing
idea lists at the start of class.  Some general heuristics for brainstorming
success can be found in the <a class="reference internal" href="ideas.html#ideation"><span>Ideation and Brainstorming</span></a> resource section.  For inspiring
examples, see <a class="reference internal" href="related_work.html#related-work"><span>Related Work</span></a> for starting points.</p>

<div class="section" id="initial-interview-preparation">
<span id="initial-interview"></span><h2>2.12. Initial Interview Preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-interview-preparation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The primary objective of the initial interview is to formulate your individual
goals for the semester.  It also serves as an opportunity for your instructor to
know you better, which will greatly help with giving constructive advice all
semester.  I hope to make this as casual, conversational, and friendly as
possible.  This is a new element of the course so I ask for your patience as the
process gets worked out.</p>
<p>The interview is scheduled for 15 minutes, please come promptly on time so we
can stay on schedule.</p>
<p>Please consider the following prompts in advance:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What do you hope to learn in this course?</li>
<li>What skills are familiar to you and could be an area for high achievement?</li>
<li>What is brand-new to you?</li>
<li>What topics seem most important?</li>
<li>What topics seem irrelevant?</li>
<li>Do you have a concrete vision for what kind of ability you&#8217;d like at the end?</li>
<li>Is there a role model you seek to emulate for this kind of work?</li>
</ol>
<p>After some discussion we will formulate a few concrete objectives.  These will
be reviewed at the mid-semester and final interviews.</p>

<div class="section" id="skills-survey">
<span id="id5"></span><h2>2.13. Skills Survey<a class="headerlink" href="#skills-survey" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first assignment is to complete a survey covering a wide range of skills and
experiences.  Please complete the following Google form: <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TscfeqLLvkCCWVtg6YC9ttGm2Aj5zuquDF_nlSZv4JQ/viewform">Skill Survey Form</a></p>
<p>Completing the skill survey is <strong>mandatory</strong>.  It does not count toward your
grade, but no other assignments will be accepted if is unfinished.</p>
<p>The results are also being collected for <a class="reference external" href="http://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/physcomp/f15/60-223">60-223</a> for comparison.</p>

<span id="ideate-gallery-profile"></span><h2>2.14. IDeATe Gallery Profile<a class="headerlink" href="#xsead-profile" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We strongly consider every student create an account on the <a class="reference external" href="http://ideate.xsead.cmu.edu/gallery/">IDeATe project
gallery</a> and fill out profile information.  It will help us to know you better
and help you to discover your cohort via the <a class="reference external" href="http://ideate.xsead.cmu.edu/profiles/">IDeATe profile index</a>.</p>
<p>I recommend that you consider using a pseudonymous handle for your account.  The
system allows for either private or public postings; some students are more
comfortable posting work publicly if it won&#8217;t be forever linked to their real
name.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need to answer during the profile interview:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>username (real or pseudonymous)</li>
<li>real name (for internal use)</li>
<li>profile image (square is best)</li>
<li>one-paragraph biography (200 chars amx)</li>
<li>focus areas (IDeATe program area interests)</li>
<li>skills with which you identify (brief phrases)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you&#8217;d like more detailed directions, we have a <a class="reference download internal" href="_downloads/GalleryInfoSheet.pdf"><code class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">PDF</span> <span class="pre">info</span> <span class="pre">sheet</span></code></a> which also addresses creating <em>projects</em> and
placing them in <em>pools</em>.</p>
<p>You may be requested to post a version of your project documentation to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://ideate.xsead.cmu.edu/gallery/pools/16-223-introduction-to-physical-computing-f15">16-223 Gallery Pool</a>.  You may also do so at your discretion.  Postings may
either be &#8216;semi-private&#8217; and viewable only by other logged-in IDeATe members or
may be &#8216;public&#8217; and open to the world.</p>
