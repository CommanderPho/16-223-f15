<span id="id2"></span><h1>3.9. SolidWorks Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#solidworks-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We have several CAD (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">computer-aided design</a>) tools available for designing
physical structures, namely <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rhino3d.com">Rhino</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.solidworks.com">SolidWorks</a>. This overview is
intended as a high-level introduction to the essential features of SolidWorks
which make it useful for this course.</p>
<p>SolidWorks is a <em>parametric</em> design tool. In the broadest sense, this makes it
closer to visual programming than drawing: parts are defined by geometric
<strong>sketch</strong> primitives constrained by <strong>relations</strong> and processed into geometric
<strong>features</strong> through operations. So a cylindrical part might be defined by a
circle on a plane that is extruded for a given distance or up to a given
point.</p>
<p>Unlike Rhino, that tree of elements is what <em>defines</em> the part and is kept
through the life of the part. So if that circle is moved, or split or reshaped,
or the extrusion distance changed, the geometry of the solid form can be
recomputed.</p>
<p>Using parametric design efficiently involves structuring the part model so that
it accurately captures <em>design intent</em>. E.g. if two particular holes are
mechanically related, their relative position can be defined by dimensions and
relations which capture that mechanical relationship.  That way, if other
features change and the part shape changes, the holes can maintain their
relationship and preserve the intent.</p>
<p>SolidWorks is especially suited for designing <strong>assemblies</strong> of
<strong>parts</strong>. Machines are typically built from individually manufactured parts
assembled together. This is captured in the design model by creating assemblies
which define the relative position of individual parts via <strong>mates</strong> which
define geometric constraints. For example, a shaft can be mated to a bearing
hole by a concentric mate which limits it to axial rotation and translation (2
remaining freedoms), then further limited by a co-planarity mate between a
groove face, snap-ring face, and bearing face which then leaves only axial
rotation free. If mates correctly correspond to actual physical constraints, the
model helps visualize that all parts have the correct freedoms. And the
parametric nature of the constraint tree means that many part dimensions can be
changed and other part positions can adapt.</p>
<p>A negative side-effect of the parametric <strong>feature tree</strong> is that if the
structure of the the design intent changes, it can be difficult to modify the
tree structure to match. This is because all features are defined in relation to
existing features, so if a <strong>parent feature</strong> is removed, the <strong>child feature</strong>
becomes only partly defined. It takes a great deal of practice to learn to
structure models well at the beginning to minimize these problems later.</p>

<h2>3.9.2. Some Good Heuristics<a class="headerlink" href="#some-good-heuristics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Always sketch your parts on paper first.</li>
<li>If you think it&#8217;s time to start modeling, <em>wait</em> and do another paper
sketch first. It is so much faster and generative.</li>
<li>If you need a standard component, check online sources for a free
model before drawing it from scratch. Be warned, though, that the exact part
models may have much more detail than you need. Modeling geometry is as much
a process of knowing what to <em>leave out</em> for a particular problem.</li>
<li>Choose a system of units and stick with it. The reality of working in
the USA is that metric and inch exist side by side throughout the catalogs
and stock. It can be cheaper to buy inch-sized parts and fasteners, but many
imported parts are designed in millimeters.</li>
<li>Before you begin modeling, consider the following: natural symmetries
in the part, the core form which is most unlikely to change and thus suitable
to be a base feature, whether the part may exist in several variations.</li>
<li>It can be hard to appreciate the scale of a CAD feature as the
computer monitor can perfectly magnify or shrink details. I recommend keeping
rulers and calipers handy for reference to remind you of exactly how much
0.001 inch or 0.1 mm actually looks in the world.</li>
<li>A solid model defined by mathematical primitives is <em>mathematically
exact</em>. Of course, any rendering of it as pixels, cutting line segments, or
rendered polygons is an approximation, and the precision is ultimately
limited by computer numerical representation. But best results are achieved
by taking advantage of mathematical constraints such as relations and mates
to maintain that exactitude. So for example, it is possible just to visually
position parts very closely in an assembly without defining mates and have it
look acceptable for a drawing. But these small errors will tend to cause
problems later when dimensions are slightly wrong in cut parts, and it
defeats the ability of the tool to help find errors such as overlapping
parts.</li>

<h2>3.9.3. Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We maintain a separate git repository on github for sample parts and projects at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-solidworks">physcomp-solidworks</a>.  This repository includes sample parts and projects, see
<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code>.</p>
<p>A complex snap-fit plastic robot assembly example is available for reference
here: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OrigamiRobotics/romibo-mechanism">romibo-mechanism</a>.  This was largely designed by Garth Zeglin, and
demonstrates several ideas for creating 3-D structures from flat parts using
interlocking joints.</p>
