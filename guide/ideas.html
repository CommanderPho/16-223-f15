<p>We all occasionally become stuck while trying to choose an idea.  Following are
a few general strategies to overcome your blocks.  If ever you feel stuck
generating ideas, try some of these steps.  Use what works, ignore the rest.</p>
<p>You also find inspiration from the <a class="reference internal" href="related_work.html#related-work"><span>Related Work</span></a> page.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Let go of your fear, let go of any preconceptions of brilliance.  Ideas are
cheap.  Dirt cheap.  The work and interest comes from thinking it through,
identifying the questions, fitting into constraints, solving the underlying
problems, identifying the difficult parts, finding the novel bits, framing
the story.  Ideas mostly arise from other ideas. Don&#8217;t wait for inspiration,
apply some systematic generation and better ideas will almost always evolve.
If you&#8217;re stuck for one idea, generate ten.</li>
<li><em>All ideas can be rendered at all scales.</em> The essence of a big idea can be
isolated down to an elegant small example.  If an appealing idea seems
intimidating or unmanageable, what is the essential bit which could tested
first as a proof of concept?  This is a good use for
<a class="reference internal" href="#regressing-the-question"><span>Regressing the Question</span></a>.</li>
<li>Look around the room, choose two things, jam them together.  E.g., &#8220;door,
concrete blocks, what about doors made of concrete?  What about a design
system for hinged concrete structures?&#8221;  I&#8217;m sure you can do better.  Or pick
two systems and try to apply arbitrary elements of one to another.  These
ideas are rarely useful but will open the doors to others.</li>
<li>Look for the hard parts: these might be opportunities, or maybe just hints to
simplify.  Follow the path of least resistance: choose your battles carefully
and make sure anything hard is actually essential and not a distraction.</li>
<li>Look for the rules and metrics: how are you going to evaluate whether the
idea fits the need?  Often defining the rubric is harder than generating the
idea itself.</li>
<li>How would you explain your idea to an alien?  How would your explain your
idea to Spock (RIP) or a perfectly rational being?  The point is to tease out
your unspoken assumptions and see if they can be adjusted.</li>
<li>For the designers lost in the absence of a client: assume <em>you</em> are the
client.  What needs do you have?  What would you like to see existing in the
world?  Or choose your ideal fantasy client: what need would they have?  If
you need a dirty canvas, look around you and pick any starting point: design
for wherever you are.</li>
<li>It may help to think of a project as the first step in a larger project; for
more ambitious ideas try to think of the smallest first step which can be
tested with some basic circuitry and mechanism.</li>
<li>The primary difference between undergraduates and graduate students is that
undergraduates have not yet learned how to follow through on an idea.  Never
rest, always relentlessly ask yourself the followup questions.</li>

<span id="id2"></span><h2>2.6.2. Regressing the Question<a class="headerlink" href="#regressing-the-question" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I first heard this articulated by <a class="reference external" href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/bio/bernie-roth/">Bernie Roth</a> in 1996 in the early days of
the <a class="reference external" href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/">Stanford d.school</a>, although the closest technique in their current
vocabulary of methods is <a class="reference external" href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/why-how-laddering.pdf">Why-How Laddering</a>.</p>
<p>In the original form, the process works as follows.  Given an idea, ask the
question: &#8220;If I actually had that solution, what would it really provide?&#8221;  This
<em>regression</em> is a means of discovering what underlying abstract needs the idea
might fulfill.  Carried out iteratively, it frequently ends up following a chain
of abstract needs to something quite fundamental (e.g. the elements of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow&#8217;s
Hierarchy</a>).  This process almost always identifies elements of your idea which
can be dropped as inessential or distracting.  From there it is possible to
follow a similar chain in reverse and find other ideas related to the first, but
frequently better and more focused.</p>
<p>The &#8220;why-how ladder&#8221; is a more concrete articulation of the process.  Given a
user need, asking &#8220;why?&#8221; questions will develop more abstract needs, possibly
iteratively.  Then asking &#8220;how?&#8221; questions will uncover more concrete
realizations parallel to the first need.</p>
<p>If you like this approach, the <a class="reference external" href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/use-our-methods">Stanford d.school methods</a> page has many more
resources related to design thinking.</p>
