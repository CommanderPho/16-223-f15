Tips and Tricks
===============

We expect you to look to outside resources for information on practical skills;
we have some starting points on the :ref:`essential-skills-list`.  For specific
problems with the lab equipment, you might the :ref:`errata` section handy.
However, this page also includes some miscellaneous notes you may find useful.


Soldering
---------

My essential soldering tips:

#. Lead is poisonous: wash your hands afterwards.
#. Turn on the fan to absorb the rosin fumes.
#. Put a little water on the sponge.
#. Melt a little solder on the tip to “tin” it.
#. Use the sponge to clean off excess solder and flux from the tip.
#. Soldering is all about heat, oxides, and surface tension: the rosin flux
   vaporizes in the heat and removes oxides so the solder can wet the metal; the
   melted solder wicks into the freshly cleaned gaps.
#. Heat the joint with the iron; let the hot joint melt the solder. The solder
   is applied to the joint, not the tip.
#. Look for a shiny, symmetrical meniscus of solder when you’re done.


Electronics
-----------

#. If an analog sensor doesn’t emit the right voltage to drive a particular
   circuit, it is possible to construct a passive resistor network to add an
   offset voltage, or an active op-amp circuit to offset and scale the signal to
   the appropriate level. E.g., the Sharp rangefinder output is too low a
   voltage to directly trigger our MOSFETs.  For more discussion see the `Op Amp
   Level Translation Exercise
