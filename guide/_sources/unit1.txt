Unit 1 Exercises: Energy, Information, Transduction
===================================================

The first unit has many exercises intended familiarize you with the lab and
basic electronic equipment and are essential for developing the vocabulary and
skills to fulfill the projects.

The lab exercises are intended to be performed by pairs of students.  The
exercises will be performed in the lab during class time, but also outside class
as needed. Each student should keep their own lab notebook as detailed in
:ref:`lab-notebook`.

The initial exercises are intended to be quick, simple introductions, but please
be sure that each member of each student pair practices each physical and
measurement skill. Part of the exercise is absorbing a set of technical terms;
the meaning will become apparent in time through immersion in practice.

The following is a suggested order which generally develops from simple to more
complex, however the sequence is not strict.  There are more exercises available
for this section than time so individuals may choose exercises according to the
experience and discretion.  If something is too elementary for your experience
level, please choose something new for you.  If an exercise requires a part
which is not available, please move on to something feasible.

Please be sure to read the :ref:`basic-circuits-guide` section for a review of
terminology and concepts.  Also, please skim the :ref:`errata` section if you
have trouble to identify mistakes in the text or general hints.

Anyone who completes the basic exercises should consider undertaking more of the
optional challenge activities listed at the end of most exercises.
