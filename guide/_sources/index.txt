This course is part of the `Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology`_ (IDeATe)
program at `Carnegie Mellon University`_ and makes use of the new `IDEATE@Hunt
Collaborative Making Facility`_ in the lower level of Hunt Library.

This course is an IDeATe Portal Course for CFA/DC/TPR students entering either
of the IDeATe `Intelligent Environments`_ or `Physical Computing`_ programs.
CIT/MCS/SCS students can enroll in the `60-223`_ version of the course, with
whom we are planning some crossover if feasible.

The main course website for Fall 2015 is at
http://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/physcomp/f15/16-223.  Additional common Physical
Computing material and the previous Fall 2014 iteration of this course can be
found at http://physcomp.org.
