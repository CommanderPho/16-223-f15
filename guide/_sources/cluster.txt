IDeATe Virtual Cluster Software
===============================

The IDeATe equipment desk includes a 'virtual cluster' of MacBook Pros with a
variety of software installed for course use which are available for checkout
from the desk.  We recommend that you use one of these computers for all
assignments.  We will provide support for helping you maintain and run the
course materials on the cluster laptops.  The :ref:`complete list of requested
software <cluster-course-software>` appears below.

You are welcome to use your own computer if you prefer, and we will endeavor to
keep the course materials widely compatible.  However, we cannot promise support
since experience has shown that troubleshooting individual student laptops can
become an unreasonable time sink.  In particular, some examples were developed
and tested under Mac OS X and are not tested in detail under Windows.  We encourage
Windows users to offer peer support to each other.

All work in this course can be performed using open-source or free software.
The following guide may help you in setting up course materials on your personal
computer.  We welcome questions, but these instructions are offered as a
courtesy and we will not be responsible for maintaining your personal system.

Installation on Personal OS X Computers
---------------------------------------


Recommended Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a minimum it is recommended to install the following applications.  See the list below for links.

#. Arduino IDE (requires Java)
#. Fritzing

Other useful applications include:

#. GitX-dev
#. CoolTerm


MacPorts
^^^^^^^^

Much of the basic open-source software can be installed via `MacPorts`_, an
open-source package installation system for OS X.  Effective use of MacPorts
requires some willingness to use the command line (e.g. Terminal.app).

The `MacPorts Quickstart instructions`_ are the best reference for initial installation, but in even shorter form:

#. Install the current XCode system from Apple if necessary.
#. Install the base system from the .pkg package file appropriate to your OS version.
#. Run an initial self-update from the command line::
     
     sudo port -v selfupdate

#. Install essential packages.  Note that this may take some time as it will download many packages and perhaps compile a few::

     sudo port install coreutils git gnuplot minicom py27-numpy py27-pyqt4 py27-pyqwt py27-scikit-learn py27-scipy py27-serial python27 qt4-mac sox

   Note that you may see many other packages installed by MacPorts as it automatically installs packages required by the ones you specify.

#. Install additional packages.  Some of these are more relevant to Raspberry Pi users::

     sudo port install Fugu doxygen emacs-app graphviz md5sha1sum nmap opencv +python27 p7zip py27-ipython py27-protobuf py27-sphinx py27-twisted py27-yaml sshfs unison xz eric4
   
   
Installation on Personal Windows Computers
------------------------------------------

As a minimum it is recommended to install the following applications.  See the list below for links.

#. Arduino IDE (requires Java)
#. Fritzing

Other useful applications include:

#. `SourceTree <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/>`__

The closest equivalent to MacPorts is the `Cygwin <https://www.cygwin.com/>`__
package system.  For the Python support the recommended solution is python(x,y).

Cluster Course Software
-----------------------

Following is the table of software requested for the virtual cluster MacBook
Pros from `Computing Services`_ on behalf of the course.

.. csv-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15, 10, 20, 20, 40
   :file: software.csv

In addition, I made the following requests for the baseline OS X installation:

#. Python, Processing, and Pd must be entered into the firewall permissions
   list; students will write networking programs which will trigger the firewall
   rules, but which they do not have authority to permit.

#. Shared profile with proper AFS support.  The current local profiles means
   students get a different environment each time they check out a cluster
   laptop, which is highly inefficient.  AFS is preferred to DFS; the DFS
   support apparently changes file metadata, rendering git nearly unusable.

Errata:

#. MacPorts package ``py27-pyqwt`` was omitted from the request list in F15.
#. MacPorts package ``eric4`` was omitted from the request list in F15.
#. OpenSCAM is now CAMotics.
#. Python(x,y) moved from Google Code to github.
