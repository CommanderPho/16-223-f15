IDeATe Facilities Policies and Fees
===================================

The IDeATe Program is special because the courses dedicate instruction toward
related workflows among multiple fields. As a result, IDeATe affiliated
resources, equipment and spaces are tailored to support various processes and
projects. After completing a course within the IDeATe\@Hunt facilities, you will
become apart of IDeATe\@Hunt community. As an IDeATe\@Hunt member, you will gain
access to a network of faculty, facilities, resources, and like-minded 'makers'.

The IDeATe\@Hunt facilities feature several resources dedicated toward creative
output. Many of these resources are expensive, including the service time
devoted toward continued operation and maintenance. In addition, some of the
spaces and equipment involve real hazards, posing safety concerns for all
users. To resolve these issues, IDeATe\@Hunt has implemented (2) primary
solutions:

#. Safety, Training & Instruction

   Spaces involving hazardous processes are only accessible by trained members
   of the IDeATe\@Hunt community. Training is fundamentally offered through
   introductory (portal) courses & workshops. Additional training is also
   offered through various IDeATe\@Hunt courses. During training you will
   receive all the instruction you require to utilize the spaces and/or
   equipment in a safe, efficient, and respectful manner.

#. Membership and Course Fees

   Course fees are charged to students participating in any IDeATe\@Hunt courses
   approximately (1) day after the ADD/DROP Deadline. These fees are determined
   by resource access (i.e. spaces & equipment), consumables (i.e. materials),
   and any other course related fees (i.e. field trips). Course fees will
   provide you with continued access to IDeATe\@Hunt resources for the remainder
   of your course participation. If you continue participating in IDeATe\@Hunt
   courses, you will receive continued access. If you choose not to participate
   in an IDeATe\@Hunt course, you may receive continued access to previously
   approved resources by purchasing an `IDeATe@Hunt membership pass`_. These
   fees are committed to future IDeATe improvements specifically related to
   improving students' experience within these spaces. Expansion projects,
   facility updates, equipment upgrades, and purchases are some of the more
   common developments these fees are dedicated toward. As an IDeATe\@Hunt
   member, your input is invaluable, therefore, IDeATe\@Hunt members determine
   where this funding is directed. Every member will gain access to a voting
   system, allowing members to submit ideas and proposals for future
   improvements and vote on which enhancements are integrated.
