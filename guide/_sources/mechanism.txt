Mechanical Behavior
===================

This section is about encoding *behavior* in machines, where behavior is
loosely interpreted as the response of a machine to a varying
environment in order to achieve an implicit goal. At the limit, this
encompasses all of robotics. However, machines can achieve their smarts
through many means including physical form which passively interacts
with the world, mechanical action which responds to forces, and
computational models which span complexity from simple reflex reactivity
to detailed world models.

Takeaway Lessons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Machines have parts which move relative to each other; the elements or
surfaces where relative motion occurs are *bearings* and serve the
functions of controlling relative motion and friction. These can be
rolling-contact devices such as *ball bearings* in which small steel
balls roll between concentric surfaces, but many common bearings are
*plain bearings* in which two surfaces simply slide over each other.
Even a book sliding on a table can be considered to be using a planar
sliding bearing formed by the book jacket and the smooth table: the
shape constrains motion to the plane, and the smooth materials limit
friction.

The common types of bearing components we will use are *bushings* and
ball bearings. Bushings are plain bearings made from a low-friction
material such as bronze.

The key principles of shaft bearing design are to consider the *radial
force* acting perpendicular to the shaft, the *axial force* (or
*thrust*) acting along the shaft, the *bending moments* induced by the
loads, and the *torque* carried by the shaft.

Most ball bearings have limits on the moments they can support, so a
good rule of thumb is to *always use bearings in pairs* such that the
shaft bending moments are counted by radial forces.

Common ball bearings can support higher radial loads than axial loads.
*Thrust bearings* are specifically designed to carry axial loads, such
as in a turntable.

Electric motors are generally high-speed low-torque devices. Actuating a
mechanism almost always requires some form of *transmission* to reduce
speed and increase torque to match a load.

For our purposes, transmissions will be built from rollers, timing
pulleys and belts, winches and cable drives, and gears. These are
mechanisms with constant-ratio *transfer functions* in which an input to
output velocities have a fixed ratio.

In general, any mechanism with a transfer function between input and
output can act as a type of transmission. Structures with non-constant
ratios include levers, cams, and linkages.

Gear tooth design comes down to a straighforward idea: find compatible
shapes which interact to produce a constant velocity ratio from input to
output. The classic involute gear tooth shape essentially creates the
simple input-output behavior of two non-slipping rollers, but with the
increased load capacity of face contact instead of frictional contact.

In practice, gears have many problems: the teeth must slide across each
other, creating noise and friction; involute teeth induce forces which
press the gears apart; high-torque metal gears are often expensive
precision parts. However, low-cost gears can be laser-cut and careful
attention to shaft stiffness can manage tooth pressure forces.

Other common design problems we will face: attaching gears and pulleys
to shafts; mounting motors and actuators; attaching feedback sensors;
using bearings to reduce friction; translating rotational to linear
motion; building rigid structures; designing for assembly; creating 3D
structures from flat parts; creating snap-fit and locking features;
designing using standard parts and fasteners.
