Project 3: Autonomous Machine
=============================

The goal of this project is to create a device which inhabits its environment to
fulfill a purpose without human interaction.  It is *autonomous* in the sense of
performing a task without direct human intervention.  The meaning of "inhabit"
is loose but is intended to suggest behavior which exhibit a varied or adaptable
response to changes in ambient circumstances.

The definition of machine autonomy is not well-defined, the term has been used
to describe freedom along a number of different axes:

 * energy autonomy: machines which carry their own power source
 * control autonomy: machine which do not require operator input
 * navigational autonomy: machines which can move through a space without guidance
 * task autonomy: machines which can solve complex tasks automatically
 * shared autonomy: machines which divide a control task between a human operator and the machine
 * sliding autonomy: machines which can smoothly shift through varying degrees
   of shared autonomy, i.e. from fully automatic operation towards fully manual
   control

The majority of artifacts we construct are *passive* with no energy source,
actuation, or computation.  Of the *active* machines we construct, we are most
aware of those intended for direct human interaction, e.g. cars, indoor
lighting, toilets, dishwashers etc.  Each of these combines directly controlled
mechanisms with behaviors which act autonomously when not actively controlled.
There are many more of which we are less aware which operate completely
autonomously, e.g. streetlights, HVAC systems, municipal water systems, factory
automation.  Many of these systems quietly carry out tasks essential for the
survival of civilization with no human guidance during normal operation.

The idea of autonomy raises a number of questions:

#. What does it mean for a machine to have *intent* or a *goal*?  Do we make any
   machines concerned only with their own survival?

#. In what ways do we encode our goals into machines?  In what ways do others
   encode *their* goals into machines *we* use?

#. How do humans express intent *unconsciously*?  What patterns of human
   behavior over time reflect our intent in ways which can be sensed and
   detected?

#. How can a machine *adapt* to changes in its environment to better fulfill
   its purpose?

There are a number of directions this project might take.  Many of your first
two projects could be categorized as autonomous but could be improved by
developing the interpretation of the sensor input or the logic of the response.
A few suggested starting points follow for brainstorming project ideas.

#. In your first two projects, what kind of information about the world did your
   prototype sense?  What other information could have been inferred?

#. What kind of changing conditions would cause your existing projects to fail?
   How could the response have adapted automatically to compensate?


Some more specific inspirations:

#. Theo Jansen's `Strandbeest`_
#. `Mark Tilden`_
#. `Simon Penny`_, `Petit Mal`_

Note that autonomy does not necessarily imply complexity.  If a machine engages
with a simple physical process, then its model of the world may also be simple.
If a machine can carefully engage with the right features of a complex system,
then it may also use a simple model.


Objectives
----------

A key objective of this project is understanding how logic and representation
can be used to decode information about the world in order to respond to events.
The most reliable sensors are those which are directly tied to the physical
phenomenon of interest, e.g., the thermistor in a thermostat directly measures
the temperature and provides an unambiguous feedback measurement.  But many
properties of interest can only be inferred from multiple measurements over
time, especially where humans are concerned.

The second key objective is understanding how to encode a goal as rules which
can infer appropriate actions from a state estimate.  This can be as difficult
at the inference problem, since the correct action may depend upon an implicit
model of how the world is affected, which itself may not be a direct process.

As before, these are intended to be research and exploration projects.
Reasonable ambition is encouraged, so we'd like you to try new things, and
failure is part of the process.  However, we will attempt to guide you away from
directions which we think are unlikely to succeed or require unreasonable levels
of effort.  But you are the ultimate arbiter of this: we won't outright say no
because we want you to learn to assess your own ambitions and skills and don't
want to stand in your way.


Milestones
----------

(*Most of this is the same as the Project 2 milestones, except for bold-face text.*)

#. **Pair selection.** We prefer that students work in pairs.  Solo workers and
   groups of three will need to make a pitch for an exception.  Groups of four
   are too large for this project.

#. **Proposal.** See :ref:`project3-proposal` for specifics.  Ideas are cheap;
   it is in the exploration that the interesting work begins.  We recommend a
   strategy of committing to a general idea early and then thinking through as
   many details as possible at the drawing and planning stage.  We find this is
   much more efficient that jumping into building too soon.

#. **Proof-of-concept.** Nearly every proposal plan leads to a set of key
   questions which form the primary hurdles.  We recommend a strategy of
   choosing a quick experiment to tackle the most difficult part *first*.
   Either the unknowns will resolve into a feasible development plan or you can
   *fail fast* on one approach and revert to another.  Either way, you won't
   have wasted effort on secondary development which becomes obviated by a
   problem.  The proof of concept will usually be a partial prototype, and in
   many cases it can be modified into a full prototype if successful.

#. **Presentation and in-class critique**. See :ref:`critiques`. An important
   learning goal of the course is clear and efficient communication between
   disciplines, and the critiques provide an opportunity to hone your skills.
   Ideally, your project will be functional and you can perhaps give a live
   demonstration and succinct explanation.  If your project has failed, then
   please explain *why* and *how* it failed and whether there is a general
   lesson to be learned.  Our critiques will consider the relative difficulty of
   the attempt.  Ambitious project ideas frequently do not work out as expected
   but can still be reframed to expose an alternative interpretation as well as
   explain the hidden traps of the original idea.

#. **Report**. See :ref:`project-report-requirements`.  For all of our projects,
   the documentation is the most tangible and durable work product.  It is also
   an important stage for reviewing and reflecting on the process and outcome.
   The same considerations about success and failure outlined above also apply
   to the written documentation.  The report due date comes two days after
   critique to allow incorporating verbal feedback.

#. **Peer evaluation**.  Each individual should write a brief
   :ref:`peer-evaluation-form` response about your partner or teammates to be
   submitted confidentially.  This serves two functions: it is the primary
   opportunity for you to reflect on the collaborative process itself, and it
   helps your instructors identify potential collaboration issues.

#. **Disassembly**.  Unfortunately, we do not have enough parts and resources to
   keep all projects intact even for the duration of the semester.  Unless your
   project is designated to keep for the open house show, please disassemble all
   components and return them to the storage bins.  This may seem obvious, but
   please be sure to complete all documentation prior to this point: students
   frequently end up taking something apart and then wishing they had one more
   photo or video.

Proposal Prompt
---------------

(*Most of this is the same as the Project 2 prompt, except for bold-face text.*)

The proposal is the counterpart to the final report: ideally, it raises all the
questions which the project might answer, even though more will be discovered during
the process.

The primary review of the proposal will be verbal in-class commentary in order
to provide the fastest possible approval.  To speed this along, please provide
in-class a *one-page document which concisely summarizes the project plan*.
Please also submit a *PDF version of the document to Blackboard* before the
end of the day on which the proposal review occurs.  Only one document need be
submitted per group, but be sure to include the names of all contributors.

A good proposal will answer as many of the following questions as pertinent.
These are prompts, not a checklist, so use your judgment as to how to formulate
a brief proposal text or outline with supporting sketches.

#. What is your big idea, in a sentence or two?  **In what sense is your
   prototype autonomous?  What kind of model of the world state is required?**

#. If you apply :ref:`why-how laddering <regressing-the-question>`, can you
   identify an essential underlying question?  What is the simplest abstraction
   of your idea?

#. Who is the audience?  This might include user, viewers, or passive bystanders.
   What is the experience of the audience?  What might they remember?

#. Are there existing projects you have referenced?  Please include citations.

#. What will your proof-of-concept entail?  Can you sketch it?  Can you sketch
   the engineering elements (circuits, mechanical drawings)?  Good drawings at
   this stage are invaluable, they can identify many potential problems much
   more efficiently than fabrication.

#. How do you propose to divide the tasks among the team?  What :ref:`roles
   <group-roles>` will you each undertake and for which parts?

#. What features do you specifically propose to *ignore*?  E.g., a project
   involving a wearable device could focus on sensing and actuation but choose
   to ignore battery operation in favor of a wired supply.  In general, we'd
   prefer you keep your workload under control by emphasizing interesting
   behavior or interactivity over fit and finish.

#. What features do you specifically propose to *test*?  How will we know if it
   worked?

#. How might the final project look?  Can you sketch it?


Summary of Deliverables
-----------------------

The following material is included in this brief by reference.  Please
familiarize yourself with the details of the documentation requirements and
schedule.

  * :ref:`project-report-requirements`
  * :ref:`lateness-policy`
  * :ref:`calendar`

I've been refining the description of the project reports in response to the
first project.  Specifically, the purpose of the report is to present the
project as a completed artifact or demonstration.  The emphasis is on relating
its performance to the human needs of the objectives and explaining the
technical choices of the implementation.  The details of the development process
are only important to the degree to which they explain specific features of the
outcome.

#. In-class proposal review and supporting PDF file.
#. In-class demonstration of proof-of-concept.
#. In-class presentation of result for critique.
#. Report zip file package as per :ref:`project-report-requirements`
#. Please keep the linked project video to less than **two minutes**.
#. Fill in the Project 3 Peer Evaluation 'test' on Blackboard.
