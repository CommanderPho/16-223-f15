Project 1: One-in One-out
=========================================

The projects are the core of this course: we want to design, build, and document
devices which blend digital and physical processes in expressive or useful ways
which answer a human question.  It is the activity which blends the technical
lessons, collaboration, and process management with an awareness of
context. This first project is intended to familiarize you with the
collaborative workflow and identify any important gaps in your skills.  Our goal
is to keep the deliverable objectives modest so the production process is not
onerous.

The following material is included in this brief by reference.  Please
familiarize yourself with the details of the documentation requirements and
schedule.

  * :ref:`project-report-requirements`
  * :ref:`lateness-policy`
  * :ref:`calendar`

Also, IDeATe has committed to exhibiting at the `Pittsburgh Maker Faire`_ on
October 10 and 11, so we will be looking for good projects to show and students
willing to volunteer to staff the table.  Project 2 won't be done by then, so we
will choosing from among Project 1 results.


Objectives
----------

For this project, we are asking you to render a version of your big idea as a
*single-input single-output* system (`SISO`_). A guiding principle of the course
is that **all ideas can be rendered at all scales**.  Your grand notions from
the ideation exercises can be abstracted into forms where the essential
questions can be tested with simple prototypes.  The simplest processes we can
use involve just a single transformed signal.

We are also asking that the input and output inhabit different sensory domains,
e.g. a sound input creates a light output, or a light input creates a mechanical
movement, etc.  This reflects our emphasis on embodiment and transformation.  We
will interpret this objective liberally; if you are concerned an idea doesn't
fit, just ask us.

We highly recommend sticking with basic electronics at this stage.  If you must
use an Arduino, you will be expected to justify why it is necessary.  Previously
we have required this and students have produced many `effective projects
without computation <http://physcomp.org/?s=1A>`__.

These are intended to be research and exploration projects: the whole point is
to learn something new, and no one is paying you for the result.  Reasonable
ambition is encouraged, so we'd like you to try new things, and failure is part
of the process.  However, we will attempt to guide you away from directions
which we think are unlikely to succeed or require unreasonable levels of effort.
But you are the ultimate arbiter of this: we won't outright say no because we
want you to learn to assess your own ambitions and skills and don't want to
stand in your way.


Milestones
----------

#. **Pair selection.** We prefer that students work in pairs.  At this point in
   the semester, it is ideal to find a partner with complementary skills so you
   can teach each other.  Solo workers and groups of three will need to make a
   pitch for an exception.  Groups of four are too large for this project.

#. **Proposal.** See :ref:`project1-proposal` for specifics.  Ideas are cheap;
   it is in the exploration that the interesting work begins.  We recommend a
   strategy of committing to a general idea early and then thinking through as
   many details as possible at the drawing and planning stage.  We find this is
   much more efficient that jumping into building too soon.

#. **Proof-of-concept.** Nearly every proposal plan leads to a set of key
   questions which form the primary hurdles.  We recommend a strategy of
   choosing a quick experiment to tackle the most difficult part *first*.
   Either the unknowns will resolve into a feasible development plan or you can
   *fail fast* on one approach and revert to another.  Either way, you won't
   have wasted effort on secondary development which becomes obviated by a
   problem.  The proof of concept will usually be a partial prototype, and in
   many cases it can be modified into a full prototype if successful.

#. **Presentation and in-class critique**. See :ref:`critiques`. An important
   learning goal of the course is clear and efficient communication between
   disciplines, and the critiques provide an opportunity to hone your skills.
   Ideally, your project will be functional and you can perhaps give a live
   demonstration and succinct explanation.  If your project has failed, then
   please explain *why* and *how* it failed and whether there is a general
   lesson to be learned.  Our critiques will consider the relative difficulty of
   the attempt.  Ambitious project ideas frequently do not work out as expected
   but can still be reframed to expose an alternative interpretation as well as
   explain the hidden traps of the original idea.

#. **Report**. See :ref:`project-report-requirements`.  For all of our projects,
   the documentation is the most tangible and durable work product.  It is also
   an important stage for reviewing and reflecting on the process and outcome.
   The same considerations about success and failure outlined above also apply
   to the written documentation.  The report due date comes two days after
   critique to allow incorporating verbal feedback.

#. **Peer evaluation**.  Each individual should write a brief
   :ref:`peer-evaluation-form` response about your partner or teammates to be
   submitted confidentially.  This serves two functions: it is the primary
   opportunity for you to reflect on the collaborative process itself, and it
   helps your instructors identify potential collaboration issues.

#. **Disassembly**.  Unfortunately, we do not have enough parts and resources to
   keep all projects intact even for the duration of the semester.  Unless your
   project is designated to show at the Maker Faire, please disassemble all
   components and return them to the storage bins.  This may seem obvious, but
   please be sure to complete all documentation prior to this point: students
   frequently end up taking something apart and then wishing they had one more
   photo or video.


.. _project1-proposal:

Proposal Prompt
---------------

The proposal is the counterpart to the final report: ideally, it raises all the
questions which the project might answer, even though more will be discovered during
the process.

The primary review of the proposal will be verbal in-class commentary in order
to provide the fastest possible approval.  To speed this along, please provide
in-class a **one-page document which concisely summarizes the project plan**.
Please submit a version of the document to Blackboard before the end of the day
on which the proposal review occurs.

A good proposal will answer as many of the following questions as pertinent.
These are prompts, not a checklist, so use your judgment as to how to formulate
a brief proposal text or outline with supporting sketches.

#. What is your big idea, in a sentence or two?  What human need does it address?

#. If you apply :ref:`why-how laddering <regressing-the-question>`, can you
   identify an essential underlying question?  What is the simplest abstraction
   of your idea?

#. Who is the audience?  This might include user, viewers, or passive bystanders.
   What is the experience of the audience?  What might they remember?

#. Are there existing projects you have referenced?  Please include citations.

#. What are the concrete objectives of a one-in one-out formulation of your
   idea? What's the hardest part?

#. What will your proof-of-concept entail?  Can you sketch it?  Can you sketch
   the engineering elements (circuits, mechanical drawings)?  Good drawings at
   this stage are invaluable, they can identify many potential problems much
   more efficiently than fabrication.

#. How do you propose to divide the tasks among the team?  What :ref:`roles
   <group-roles>` will you each undertake and for which parts?

#. What features do you specifically propose to *ignore*?  E.g., a project
   involving a wearable device could focus on sensing and actuation but choose
   to ignore battery operation in favor of a wired supply.  In general, we'd
   prefer you keep your workload under control by emphasizing interesting
   behavior or interactivity over fit and finish.

#. What features do you specifically propose to *test*?  How will we know if it
   worked?

#. How might the final project look?  Can you sketch it?
