Exercise: Pressure pad with bias resistor
-----------------------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Measure mechanical pressure as a varying voltage.

A *pressure pad* (i.e. `force-sensing
resistor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Sensitive_Resistor>`__, or
FSR) is a contact sensor in which the resistance changes in response to
mechanical pressure. The resistance decreases with increased force. A
voltage divider circuit can be used for forming a voltage which depends
on the pressure.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. The circuit diagram shows a homebrew conductive fabric FSR but you
   may use a commercial FSR at first. These are labeled “pressure
   sensor” and can be found in the Sensors cabinet.
#. Measure the resistance of the pressure pad by itself over different
   pressure conditions.
#. The exact value of the bias resistor depends on the properties of
   your sensor. A good starting point is a resistance equal to the
   mid-range resistance of the sensor.
#. Measure the pressure pad voltage in the given circuit over different
   pressure conditions.
#. Using the oscilloscope to observe the pressure pad voltage, try
   creating rapidly changing contact to estimate the response speed.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

Commercial FSRs can be damaged by excessive force. In practice, it can
take care to design them within a mechanical assembly so they are not
directly exposed to excessive force or forces which pull them apart. But
they are a relatively cheap and robust way to make an analog human
interface.

As a challenge, rather than use a packaged FSR device, make your own
using tape and conductive fabric. Please see the following as a guide.

Conductive fabric can also be damaged by excessive force and can some
types can wear out from washing. But these sensors can be incorporated
into clothing, made with multiple sensitive points, turned into tilt
sensors and linear controls, etc.
