Exercise: MOSFET Transistor Driver
----------------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Amplify a control signal using a MOSFET transistor.

A `transistor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor>`__ is a type of
three-terminal semiconductor component which allows a control current or
voltage at the *base* or *gate* terminal to affect the current flowing
through the device. A `MOSFET <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET>`__
is a particular type of transistor with very high current gain; the gate
input has very high impedance, such that a gate voltage with very little
current can control the current flowing between the *source* and
*drain*. This makes it very convenient for interfacing logic-level
signals to loads such as motors.

MOSFETs have a linear range in which the current is proportional to the
gate voltage, but this exercise will use it in a *saturation* mode in
which it is either on or off. MOSFETS come in both P-channel and
N-channel varieties exhibiting different polarities; this exercise uses
an N-channel MOSFET in which a small positive gate voltage relative to
the source terminal will cause a positive current to flow from drain to
source, activating the motor.

MOSFETs have very low forward voltage, i.e., the voltage drop across the
source and drain can be very low, meaning there is very little power
dissipated for a given current.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Set the power supplies to the specified voltages first. We are using
   a low-voltage motor so the 1V is actually the ‘high-power’ energy
   supply and the 5V is the logic supply. The MOSFET can handle
   substantially higher currents than used by this motor.
#. Manually connect and disconnect the gate voltage, observing the motor
   operation. If disconnecting the gate does not turn off the
   transistor, try grounding the gate. Even a small static charge on the
   gate can be enough to turn it on.
#. Measure the gate current and resistance, and compute the power
   dissipated by the gate input. (It should be very low.)
#. Measure the motor current, and compute the power dissipated by the
   motor.
#. Compute the power gain of the amplifier: the output power divided by
   the input power.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

Note that unlike the relay circuit, the input and output circuits are
not isolated from each other.

MOSFETS are fast and silent. Modern MOSFETS can handle relatively high
power loads with minimal dissipation. The parts are polarized, and
driving an output with both positive and negative current (e.g. for
directional control) requires multiple parts and steering logic, e.g. an
H-Bridge configuration. The polarization also makes them unsuitable for
controlling AC circuits. More details can be found on the `data sheet
for the IRF540 MOSFETs we stock in the
lab <http://www.irf.com/product-info/datasheets/data/irf540n.pdf>`__.

Note that the MOSFET symbol includes a reverse-biased `Zener
diode <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode>`__ which exists as a
byproduct of the transistor structure. If the voltage across the MOSFET
becomes sufficiently reversed, it will begin to conduct (“avalanche”)
and can be destroyed. This circuit has no apparent negative voltages,
however, the motor coil is an inductor which can create negative voltage
spikes as it turns off. With larger motors in particular, it can be
important to place a `protective clamp
diode <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode>`__ around the motor
which normally does not conduct but turns on to absorb large reverse
voltages.
