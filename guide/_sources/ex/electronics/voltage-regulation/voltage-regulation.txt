Exercise: Voltage Regulation
----------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Test different types of voltage regulation components.

Power supplies are the heart of any electronics project, as every
circuit needs a source of energy, and usually with very specific
electrical characteristics. Most of our circuits will require regulated
DC supplies, with energy coming either from a battery or the building
electrical system. Unless otherwise specified, *regulated* means the
voltage is controlled to a constant level despite changes in the load.

We will use two basic categories of voltage regulators: linear and
switching.

In brief, a linear regulator acts as a variable resistor governed by
feedback to keep the output voltage at a fixed level. Linear regulators
can only step voltages down, and the excess energy is dissipated as
heat. So for example, a 5V linear regulator providing a 500 mA current
from a 12V supply creates a 7V voltage drop. That represents 3.5 Watts
of heat dissipated in the package, which typically means the package
needs a good heatsink to carry that heat away.

A switching regulator chops the input current at a high frequency and
either pulses it through an inductor (a coil) to generate higher
voltages via inductive effects, or filters it through capacitors and/or
inductors to generate a lower voltage. The upside of the complexity is
much higher efficiency, and hence less heat. The downside is the
potential for supply noise, since the switching frequency can appear in
the output. But the efficiency almost always outweighs the complexity in
consumer applications, especially for battery circuits.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Wire up each circuit, beginning with the 7805 linear regulator. Be
   very careful to observe the correct input polarity. You may
   substitute a lab supply for the battery.
#. Measure the unloaded outputs. Not all switching regulators perform
   well without any load at all.
#. Find a power resistor or component representing a reasonable load.
   E.g., dissipating 100 mA from a 5V regulator can be accomplished
   using a 0.5 Watt 50 ohm resistor, or a lamp or motor with similar
   properties. (Hint: a half-watt 50 ohm resistor can be formed from two
   quarter-watt 100 ohm resistors in parallel.)
#. Measure the loaded output.
#. For the switching regulators, using the oscilloscope try to observe
   the switching rate as a high-frequency fluctuation on the output.
   This signal might be 20-100 kHz.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

In the first example of a linear regulator dropping a 12V input to a 5V
output, the the load is only consuming 2.5 Watts of energy while the
regulator dissipates 3.5 Watts, so this circuit is operating at only 42%
efficiency. Linear regulator circuits are simple to use and inexpensive,
so they are applicable for low-power applications or where efficiency
and heating are not a problem. The primary advantage is they are
potentially low-noise compared to switching regulators, so they often
appear in high-fidelity audio applications.

Despite the power inefficiency, we encourage you to use linear
regulators such as the 7805 in your projects whenever feasible as they
are low-cost and robust and well-suited to simple projects.

In contrast, switching regulators typically operate as 85% efficiency or
higher. The availability has been remarkably eased by the introduction
of simple integrated circuits which implement the chopping and feedback
function. Consumer 'wall-wart' power supplies used to only use simple
linear regulation (or no regulation), but nearly all modern power
supplies for consumer electronics are now switch-mode.

A good debugging heuristic for any project is to begin solving problems
by checking the power supply. There are many, many possible problems, so
for example:

#. overloading a power supply can cause the voltage to drop or current
   limits to trip
#. power supplies connect across every circuit subsystem, so signal
   problems can be linked in subtle ways
#. high-current signals from motors can create voltages in the ground
   wires (“ground bounce”)
#. digital supply noise can couple into analog circuits and inject noise
#. etc., etc.
