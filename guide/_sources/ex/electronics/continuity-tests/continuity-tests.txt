Exercise: Continuity Tests
--------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Learn typical scale of resistance units.

Metals are generally good at conducting electricity; they have low
resistance. Common insulators (including air) have a resistance high
enough it can't be easily measured. So the most basic resistance
measurement is the 'continuity check' which simply tests whether the
resistance is low enough to be considered a conductor, or whether it is
unexpectedly high representing an open circuit.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Set the DMM to resistance: Ohms, or the large greek omega letter Î©.
   The DMM will emit a small voltage to measure the current which flows
   in response through the resistance path between the probes.
#. Hold the probe tips in your fingers. This is safe, the DMM voltage
   emitted is very low. Squeeze harder. Moisten the contact point. You
   should see a body resistance reading which changes with conditions.
#. Touch the probes to a coin, keys, and metal tool surfaces. If you
   fail to see a low reading, try changing contact points, scratching
   the surface, and pressing harder.
#. Touch the probes across the leads of a resistor. The quarter-watt
   resistors with wire leads we use in the lab have `colored bands which
   encode the specified
   value <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code>`__.
#. Touch the probes across the leads of an LED. Reverse the connections.
#. Try measuring resistance through other natural objects, food,
   furniture, etc. Write down your results.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

Typical resistance measurements along a short wire will be less than 1
ohm and are often dominated by the resistance of the contact point and
probe wires. Component resistors are available in standard ranges from a
fraction of an ohm to tens of millions of ohms. For our typical sensor
circuits we will be using resistors in the 100 to 10000 (10K) ohm range.
