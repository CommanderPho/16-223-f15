Exercise: Relay Driver
----------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Connect two circuits using a relay.

A `relay <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay>`__ is a mechanical switch
controlled by an electrical signal. A current through the control coil
creates a magnetic field which physically moves an electrical contact
from a normally-closed (NC) contact to a normally-open (NO) contact. In
most relays, the switch immediately returns to the normally-closed state
when the coil is de-energized. Relays come in many shapes, sizes, and
configurations; this exercise uses a relatively small relay controlled
by a 5V signal.

We can look at it in several ways: as an *interface* between an
informational signal and an energetic signal; as a binary *amplifier*
which allows a modest control signal to control a high-power energetic
circuit; as an *isolator* which allows the input circuit to affect the
output circuit without sharing any current.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Try wiring the circuit only from the schematic rather than the
   breadboard diagram; now is the time to become used to reading
   schematics and rendering them onto the breadboard using your own
   judgement.
#. Set the power supplies to the specified voltages first. We are using
   a low-voltage motor so the 3V is actually the ‘high-power’ energy
   supply and the 5V is the logic supply.
#. Manually connect and disconnect the coil circuit, listening for the
   physical motion inside the relay and observing the different output
   states.
#. Measure the coil current and resistance, and compute the power
   dissipated by the coil.
#. Measure the motor current, and compute the power dissipated by the
   motor.
#. Compute the power gain of the amplifier: the output power divided by
   the input power.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

Relays are relatively slow but very robust. The contacts are just switch
contacts, so they have no polarity, and many relays are suitable for
safely switching AC line circuits. There are other variants on relays
such as *latching relays* in which one coil is pulsed to change state
and another pulsed to change it back. There are relays with many sets of
contacts for controlling multiple output circuits from a single control
coil.

Relays are the original form of logic component; it is possible to build
a `programmable computer using nothing but
relays <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I>`__. The early
automatic telephone switches made extensive use of `elaborate
electromechanical
switches <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepping_switch>`__.

Small challenge: set up a relay circuit in which the coil current passes
through the NC contact in series with the coil. What do you expect will
happen?
