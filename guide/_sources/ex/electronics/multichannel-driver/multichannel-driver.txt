Exercise: Multichannel Bipolar Transistor Driver
------------------------------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Interface multiple motors using an integrated driver.

An `integrated
circuit <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit>`__ (aka IC or
chip) is a multi-component circuit fabricated on a single piece of
semiconductor material. The complexity ranges from just a few
transistors up to billions of components in a high-end CPU chip.

This exercise uses a `ULN2803
driver <http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/uln2803a.pdf>`__ which provides
the equivalent of eight individual transistor drive circuits in a single
package, enough to drive eight relays or turn eight motors on an off. It
is polarized, so each channel is either on or off and conducts only one
direction. The outputs are *open-collector*, which in practice means
they sink a positive current to a common ground.

Unlike the MOSFET, the bipolar transistors have a noticeable voltage
drop and dissipate more power for the same output current. We use these
parts because they are inexpensive, robust, and have the convenience of
multiple channels.

Note that the inputs are engineered for 5V logic, but the outputs are
rated to 50V, so the load can be a DC load at a substantial higher
voltage than the logic. Each output is rated for 500 mA maximum current,
but in practice the maximum load that can be switched is a function of
the overall dissipation. E.g., running too many outputs at too high a
current may exceed the total heating limit, which is a function of the
package type and heat-sinking.

The outputs include `clamp diodes
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode>`__ connected to the COM terminal
which help absorb voltage spikes typically created when motors or relay coils
turn off.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Wire up the circuit, trying to use only the schematic. This is also a
   good opportunity to look at the `data sheet for the
   ULN2803 <http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/uln2803a.pdf>`__.
#. Using a jumper wire, apply 5V (‘HIGH’) to IN7 and IN8, observing the
   motor activity.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

The actual topology of each channel is a *Darlington pair*, a circuit
which uses two bipolar transistors cascaded for higher gain. The data
sheet includes a schematic approximating the circuit for each channel.

The logic symbol is drawn as a triangle with a circle at the output
representing an *inverted* output which is active-low. In practice, the
‘low’ output is generally sinking power through the load, so it still
represents the ‘active’ state, i.e., a high input turns the load on.

Like the MOSFET circuit, note hat the input and output circuits are not
isolated from each other.
