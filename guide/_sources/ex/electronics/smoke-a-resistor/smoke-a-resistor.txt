Exercise: Smoke a Resistor
--------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Destroy a resistor to observe the effects of excessive dissipation.
Destroy a red LED to observe the non-linear current characteristic.

Resistors generate heat as current flows through them. If the applied voltage
rises too high, they will heat up until they smoke or melt. The power dissipated
is the voltage drop multiplied by the current: :math:`P = V * i`. Since the
voltage drop across a resistor is proportional to the current (:math:`V = i *
R`), the power dissipated can also be expressed as :math:`P = i^2 * R = V^2 /
R`.

The small resistors we use in the lab are rated for 0.25 Watts of
dissipation. So for example, a 100 ohm resistor will dissipate 0.25
Watts with an applied voltage of 5V: the current will be 50 mA (5V / 100
ohms), and the power will be 0.25 Watts (5V \* 0.050 A). As the voltage
increases they will dissipate power according to the square of the
voltage, so they will get hotter and hotter and quickly fail.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Adjust the power supply for 5V output. Measure the resulting current
   through a 100 ohm quarter-watt resistor.
#. Check if the resistor is getting warm.
#. Raise the power supply to 7V output, which will double the dissipated
   energy to a half-Watt: :math:`P = V^2/ R = 7*7 / 100 = 0.49W`.
#. Check if the resistor getting warm. Careful not to burn yourself.
#. Continue raising the power voltage slowly until the resistor fails.
   Note the final voltage and current.
#. As noted in the previous LED exercise, LEDs have a non-linear
   characteristic in which the current rapidly rises as the voltage
   climbs. Find an inexpensive red LED and measure its *forward voltage*
   using the diode measurement function on the DMM. For a red LED, this
   will typically be in the vicinity of 1.6V.
#. Set the power supply about half a volt below the forward voltage.
   Attach the LED. Very slowly increase the applied voltage, observing
   the LED. The light should get very bright very quickly around the
   forward voltage, and at just a slightly higher voltage, the LED will
   heat up and stop working permanently.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

Resistors are cheap, so this is pretty harmless, even if it smells bad.
It is heartbreaking to overvoltage an expensive component and “let out
the magic smoke” so it stops working.
