Exercise: Transducer with DMM
-----------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Measure the response of a modular sensor.

Many sensors are available as convenient modules which incorporate the
required support components. In this example, the module simply requires
regulated power to directly output an analog voltage representing a
physical property.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Double-check the power supply voltage before connecting to the
   circuit. Many modules require tightly regulated voltage and will be
   destroyed at higher input voltages and malfunction at lower input
   voltages.
#. Measure the output voltage at different physical conditions.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

A *buffered* or *amplified* module can drive a modest current through
the output if needed; it has a *low-impedance* output. Many unbuffered
or unamplified sensors only output a small current or voltage and
require an amplifier to bring the signal to a usable level.

When in doubt, consult the datasheet or spec sheet for the module for
specific ratings on supply voltage and details of the output signal.

For a challenge, try testing a GP2Y0A21YK0F Analog Distance Sensor:
these are very useful active sensors which emit infrared light and
measure the distance to the nearest object using the parallax of the
reflection.

Other challenges: try testing a joystick, the “Electret Microphone”
module which measures the overall sound energy level, or the ENC-03RC
single axis gyro. These are all sensors with analog outputs; some of the
other stock communicates digitally over I\ :sup:`2`\ C, which will use
in a later exercise.
