Exercise: Photocell with bias resistor
--------------------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Measure changing light level as a varying voltage.

A *CdS photocell* (i.e. `Cadmium-Sulfide
photoresistor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cds_cell>`__) is a light
sensor in which the resistance changes in response to illumination. They
are relatively slow, with a time constant of hundreds of milliseconds,
but useful for measuring ambient light and shadow. The resistance
decreases in bright light.

A voltage divider circuit can be used for forming a voltage which
depends on the light level. The value of the fixed resistor depends upon
the desired sensitivity range; a good starting point is 10K ohms.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Measure the resistance of the photocell over different illumination
   conditions.
#. Measure the photocell voltage in the given circuit over different
   illumination conditions.
#. Using the oscilloscope to observe the photocell voltage, try creating
   rapidly changing shadows to estimate the response speed.
#. Construct a simple setup to indirectly measure a physical property
   using a photocell. This can be as simple as using paper to occlude
   the light sensor as a function of mechanical position. (Keep this
   simple, this should only take a minute or two.)

Comments
^^^^^^^^

Rapid light changes and optically encoded data are better measured with
phototransistors and photodiodes. But even slow and cheap light sensors
can be adapted to measure many other properties indirectly, e.g.
chemicals, dust, mechanical position, acceleration, proximity, etc.

For a challenge, find one of the laser diodes and measure the photocell
response to the laser beam.
