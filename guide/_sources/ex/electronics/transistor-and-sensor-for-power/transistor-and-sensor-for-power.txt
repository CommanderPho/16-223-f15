Exercise: Linear One-In One-Out
-------------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Connect light to motion via electricity.

This exercise uses a single-input single-output system which couples a
light level to a motor activation. A photoresistor modulates the base
current of a bipolar transistor, controlling the current flowing through
the collector and emitter to operate a motor. This represents one
possible minimal solution to the first graded assignment.

This is an analog circuit inasmuch as the photoresistor current can be
set to keep the transistor operating in a linear range, continuously
varying the motor speed. If the base current is high or low enough, the
transistor will either saturate or shutoff and act as a digital device
in that it will simply be ON or OFF.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Wire up the circuit, trying to use only the schematic.
#. Modulate the incident light, observing the motor, trying to find the
   linear operating region. If necessary, adjust the supply voltages.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

In practice, transistor circuits usually have additional *bias
resistors* to supply positive or negative currents to keep the
transistor operating in the desired region. This is a deep topic which
leads into the art of analog circuit design. For an idea of this, look
up “audio circuits” on Google Images and `see what comes
out <https://www.google.com/search?q=audio+circuits&tbm=isch>`__.

This circuit is a very simple example of a `class-A
amplifier <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier#Class_A>`__ using a
`common-emitter
topology <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-emitter>`__; there are
many other types of amplifying transistor circuits. In general we will
use PWM to control motor speed using a simple type of class-D amplifier
for better power efficiency.
