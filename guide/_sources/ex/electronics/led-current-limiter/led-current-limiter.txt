Exercise: LED with current limiter
----------------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Light an LED using a safely limited current.

An LED is a *Light Emitting Diode*, a type of semiconductor component
which emits light directly from a current. The light results from
energized electrons moving between quantum states, and so the light
emitted has narrow spectral bands with color depending upon the specific
chemical composition. White LEDs are actually a composite structure of
multiple LEDs of different colors. White LED light is still narrow-band,
unlike the wide-spectrum black-body white light emitted from
incandescent bulbs.

A *diode* is a two-terminal semiconductor device which only conducts
current in one direction. For this reason, LEDs are *polarized*, and
will not light up if connected backward (*reverse-biased*).

Diodes can be modeled as a non-linear resistance which changes with the
applied voltage: when reverse-biased, the resistance is very high, and
almost no current flows. When forward-biased at small voltages below the
*forward voltage*, the resistance is still high and only a small current
flows. Above the forward voltage, the resistance rapidly drops and the
diode can conduct substantial current. For LEDs, this is also the point
at which they start to light up.

However, this poses a problem, since an LED connected directly to a
power source with a voltage higher than the forward voltage will enter a
very low-resistance state, conduct a lot of current, and often burn out
or melt. We will frequently solve this by using a *ballast resistor* in
series with the LED. This forms a voltage divider which acts as a very
simple current regulator.

A typical red LED has a forward voltage of 1.6V and a full-on operating
current of 20 mA.The calculation for choosing the right ballast resistor
follows this reasoning:

#. the current flow through the resistor and LED should be 20 mA for
   full brightness
#. the voltage drop across the resistor should bring the LED applied
   voltage to approximately the forward voltage
#. assuming a 5V supply voltage, a 3.4V drop across resistor brings the
   LED voltage to 1.6V
#. for the resistor, R = V / i, so R can be approximately 170 ohms (i.e.
   3.4V / 0.020A).

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Before applying power, measure the variable resistor and adjust it to
   the upper end of its resistance range.
#. Apply 5V and observe the LED light output. Reverse the polarity of
   the LED to see both forward and backward states.
#. Measure the LED current while full-on.
#. Slowly adjust the variable resistor (a *potentiometer*) until the LED
   current is 20mA.
#. Measure the resistor value.
#. Measure the LED voltage drop, resistor voltage drop, and supply
   voltage.
#. Don't reduce the potentiometer setting further or it may be damaged.
   Later you will deliberately destroy an LED to see the outcome.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

The potentiometer can be damaged by excessive current in this circuit
when the wiper moves close to the powered end since a lot of current
will flow through a small resistor.

Green and blue LEDs usually have a higher forward voltage, sometimes as
high as 3.5V. Blue LEDs were invented much more recently than red LEDs,
it took many years to find an affordable chemical composition.

The lab also stocks infrared (IR) LEDs which emits invisible light; this
is the same type used by many remote controls.

For a challenge, find one of the four-terminal RGB LEDs and set up a
circuit to create different colors.
