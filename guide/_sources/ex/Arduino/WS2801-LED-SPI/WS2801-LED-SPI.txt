Exercise: WS2801 RGB LED SPI Module
-----------------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Communicate digital data between an Arduino and a WS2801 LED RGB module
using an SPI bus.

Please be sure to review the general information about I\ :sup:`2`\ C
and SPI in the `Adafruit PWM I2C
Module <../Adafruit-PWM-I2C/index.html>`__ exercise prior to starting
this one.

This exercise will use a `RGB LED strip
module <http://www.bestlightingbuy.com/12v-ws2801-digital-intelligent-led-strip.html>`__
based on the `WS2801 constant current LED
driver <http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2801.pdf>`__, also
available in a `variety of other form
factors <http://www.adafruit.com/search?q=ws2801&b=1>`__.

These modules accept a 24-bit color value over an SPI bus, then begin to
relay any additional bits to the downstream SPI connection. This allows
daisy-chaining many RGB LEDs into an individually addressable array of
pixels. Once a short pause occurs in the input data, the received values
are transferred to the internal PWM generator. This allows simultanous
update of the whole chain for clean animation.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Download or find the complete `WS2801_test`_ sketch.
#. Plug the RGB module into a breadboard and use solid wire to make the
   following three connections from the Arduino to the module. Note
   carefully that this module uses 12V; be very careful to keep the 12V
   wiring away from the Arduino:

   #. PIN11 (MOSI) -> DAT
   #. PIN13 (SCK) -> CLK
   #. GND -> GND

   MOSI is an acronym for Master-Out Slave-In. Since this example only
   outputs data and does not receive, MISO is left unconnected.
#. Set up a bench supply for 12V and attach it to the Arduino GND and
   the 12V input on the module.
#. Attach the Arduino to your computer and install the sketch.
#. Observe the changing colors.
#. Using an oscilloscope, observe the clock and data lines. The data
   rate is fast, so you should see one very short burst per output
   frame.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

It is possible to control hundreds of LEDs on a single strand. This is becoming
a very popular way to produce architectural lighting and persistence-of-vision
(POV) displays.
