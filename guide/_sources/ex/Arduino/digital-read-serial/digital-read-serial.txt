Exercise: Digital Read Serial
-----------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Measure a binary physical property as a single-bit number.

Some devices in the physical world do approximate a digital reality:
switches are usually either on or off. But even these devices have
non-ideal properties reflecting the physical reality, e.g. switch
contacts can “bounce” as they make contact, creating a momentary pulse
train rather than a clean on/off transition.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Load and run the DigitalReadSerial sketch.
#. Observe the numbers printed in the serial monitor as the switch
   changes state.
#. Try to observe switch bounce, e.g. several transitions measured for a
   single physical transition.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

A digital input is essentially a single-bit analog-to-digital converter,
albeit with an ambiguously defined threshold between the voltages
representing zero and one. The digital input sampling rate can be much
higher than the 10-bit ADC, so much higher frequency digital signals
could be processed with careful real-time programming.

A related challenge exercise is the `Arduino RCtime
tutorial <http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/RCtime>`__ in which a
photoresistor-capacitor circuit is used to form an ad-hoc ADC using a
single digital I/O pin. Multiple bits of conversion resolution are
obtained from measuring the single input bit over time.
