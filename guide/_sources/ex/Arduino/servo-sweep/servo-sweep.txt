Exercise: Servo Sweep
---------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Control a hobby servomotor module.

Hobby servos are feedback-controlled motors which move an output shaft
to a specified position. Internally they use a potentiometer to measure
the actual position. The internal circuit compares the actual and
commanded position and generates positive and negative motor current
pulses to operate a tiny gearmotor. They are a very convenient modular
way to create controlled physical motion.

The commanded position is specified using a specific format of PWM in
which pulses with duration approximately 1-2 ms repeat at approximately
50 Hz. The different pulse widths correspond to different positions.
Note that this a significantly different waveform than the motor PWM,
since the *duty cycle* is always very low, i.e., the pulse on-time is
always much shorter than the cycle time.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Load and run the Servo/Sweep sketch. This uses the Servo library, an
   included add-on to the base library.
#. Observe the servo motion.
#. Observe the PWM command signal on the oscilloscope.
#. Try varying the numbers governing the motion limits.
#. Try varying the delay to change the speed.
#. Determine the maximum speed possible.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

Note that trajectories and speed control are only possible by issuing
position commands at intervals.

As a challenge, rewrite the program to avoid ``delay()`` and operate two
servos simultanously on different trajectories. This will be taken up in
more detail in an upcoming exercise.
