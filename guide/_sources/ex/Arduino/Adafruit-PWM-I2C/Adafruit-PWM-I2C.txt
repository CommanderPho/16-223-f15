Exercise: Adafruit PWM I2C Module
---------------------------------

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Communicate digital data between an Arduino and a PWM module using an
|I2C| bus.

The Arduino I/O pins allow it to bridge the gap directly between digital
information and physical signals. However, it can also transmit data to
and from other computational devices. The previous examples have
implicitly used USB and an asynchronous serial UART for downloading
programs and looking at text output. But even simpler bus standards,
such as |I2C| and SPI are useful for connecting an Arduino
to I/O modules or even other Arduinos.

This capability is useful for rapid prototyping, since many interface
functions are available in modular form. For example, there exist
modules:

#. to extend the number of available digital inputs or outputs
#. with specialized electrical behavior such as automatic current
   regulation or PWM generation
#. which can provide RGB color LED illumination controlled purely by
   digital data, including PWM generation and power drive

Using digital busses essentially makes the Arduino a node in a network
comprising multiple computers, possibly including a host desktop or
laptop. Each type of link has different characteristics:

-  SPI is normally a point-to-point connection, or sometimes
   one-to-many. It can be relatively fast (e.g. up to 25 mbps). It
   requires four wires for bidirectional communication but supports
   *full-duplex* transfer with simultaneous input and output.
   Output-only connections can use just three wires. It is designed for
   short-range connection to simple devices such as a chain of LED
   modules or a high-resolution ADC.
-  |I2C| can connect multiple devices on a single bus. It is
   relatively low speed, typically 400 kbps to one mbps. It uses three
   wires with separate clock and data but is half-duplex. The protocols
   are more elaborate and involve specific phases of transmitting device
   addresses and receiving replies. It is designed for short-range
   connection within a single system.

In general, using a device-level serial bus requires using two
libraries: one to handle the |I2C| or SPI data transfer, and
one to handle the specific protocol for the device. If no device library
is available, then this involves understanding the datasheet for the
particular device well enough to implement the required protocol. This
can be as simple as emitting a few bytes to write a value to a device
register, but sophisticated devices can require elaborate programs to
handle a variety of messages. For example, a real-time clock-calendar
chip can have dozens of registers available over an |I2C| bus
to keep track of time and set alarms.

This exercise will use the `Adafruit 815 16 channel 12-bit PWM driver
with I2C interface <http://www.adafruit.com/products/815>`__. This
module is based on the `PCA9685 I2C-bus controlled 16-channel LED
controller <http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/PCA9685.pdf>`__. Adafruit
`provides their own
tutorial <https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver>`__,
and `library source code on
github <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library>`__.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Download or find the complete `Adafruit_PWM`_ sketch included with
   the exercise. This is the pwmtest example from
   Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library, slightly modified into a
   self-contained sketch. If you have cloned the course materials from
   github, it will be in the same folder as this page, or it can be
   `downloaded directly <Adafruit_PWM/index.html>`__. Be sure to fetch
   all top-level files.
#. Load the sketch into the Arduino IDE and use Verify to make sure it
   compiles on your system.
#. Plug the PWM module into a breadboard and use solid wire to make the
   following four connections from the Arduino to the module:

   #. 5V -> VCC
   #. GND -> GND
   #. A4 -> SDA
   #. A5 -> SCL

#. Connect the Arduino to your computer and download the sketch.
#. Using an oscilloscope, observe the SCL clock line and the SDA data
   line. You should see complex digital waveforms. At the right time
   scale, you should be able to see regular bursts of pulses on the
   clock line and varying bursts on the data line. Each burst is about
   200 microseconds long and represents a command message being
   sequentially shifted between the two devices.
#. Using an oscilloscope, observe several of the PWM pins on the 3x4
   headers. You should see a smoothly varying PWM waveform.
#. Touch an LED between a PWM and GND pin (observing polarity) and you
   should see a smoothly varying illumination. This module includes 220
   ohm resistors in series with the output so no dropping resistor is
   necessary. If you attach several LEDs, you can see the smooth pattern
   produced by the example program.

Comments
^^^^^^^^

This example is more about becoming comfortable using vendor libraries
than the electronics, given how simple it is to make the electrical
connections.

For a challenge, clone the original Adafruit library from github and
install it in your Arduino IDE libraries path, then try compiling the
original unmodified example.
