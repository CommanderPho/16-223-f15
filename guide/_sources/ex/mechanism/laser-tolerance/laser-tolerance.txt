Exercise: Laser Cutting Features and Tolerances
-----------------------------------------------

**Note: this is a new exercise, please provide feedback on errors and
clarity.**

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Understand basic design considerations for laser-cut acrylic parts.
Learn to operate the laser cutter, measure features, and choose design
elements compatible with laser-cutting in acrylic.

Process Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Laser cutters are extremely useful tools for cutting complex 2D forms.
Their best feature for our coursework is the speed with which an idea
can be tested: it is possible to conceive of a part, create a 2D
drawing, output a DXF, and cut material to make a functional part within
*minutes*.

Laser cutters are intrinsically two-dimensional tools: a focused beam of
infrared laser light (e.g. invisible to the human eye) moves on a XY
gantry under computer control to trace out curves and lines. The beam is
turned on and off to start and end lines during cutting. It may also be
used in a raster engraving mode in which it sweeps an area while
modulating the beam power very quickly to vary the cut and create an
image on the surface.

The fundamental cutting process is **melting** or **burning** from the
heat resulting from absorbing the energy of the light. An air jet blows
downwards into the cut area to help move melted material out of the cut
before it resolidifies. The cutter bed can be moved up or down prior to
cutting to place the top plane of the flat material at the focal point
of the laser.

Design Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cut file specifies the centerline for the laser path, but the width
of the **kerf** means that material will be cut on either side of the
beam path. So an inside edge such as a hole will have a slightly
**larger** diameter than drawn and an outside edge will have a slightly
**smaller** width or diameter than drawn. Any hole will be slightly
**conical** since the cuts are slightly tapered top to bottom.

The idea of `engineering
tolerance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance>`__ has
several different meaning in practice related to choosing design
parameters which can accommodate physical variations. For mass-produced
parts, the variation can include dimensional imprecision from part to
part. For parts subject to environmental changes, the variation might be
changes in dimension or material properties resulting from thermal or
humidity changes. A robust design will include features and parameter
choices which can accommodate these variations to an acceptable level.

The laser-cutting process has several sources of variation: the cutter
itself changes calibration as the optics are dirtied and the laser ages,
the focal depth can be miscalibrated from pass to pass, the material
does not always have an exact thickness, and the XY drive mechanism has
backlash and positioning error.

Tolerant Design Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Handwork**. If parts are always cut slightly undersize, they can be
hand-filed and trimmed to fit. This is labor-intensive and consistency
is difficult, although for a very simple part sometimes the fastest
solution.

**Iterative Adjustment**. The part design can be adapted to the current
process parameters by measuring a cut part and adjusting the design
file. This can be time-consuming to iterate and is not necessarily
stable in the face of day-to-day variations. It can however lead to very
precise parts, cut within the intrinsic mechanical precision of the
cutter.

**Tolerant Design**. The part can be designed to allow process variation
and still retain function. This eliminates handwork at the cost of more
careful design. However, it may also require reduced part precision.
Techniques include: using tapered features, using fasteners, adding
extra alignment features, carefully choosing structural topology.

Exercise Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this exercise, we are providing sample laser-cuttable parts to
demonstrate a few techniques for building reliable structures out of
acrylic. These are intended as starting points for your own designs. The
sources for these designs can be found in the
`physcomp-solidworks <https://github.com/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-solidworks>`__
git repository on github.

The Physical Computing Lab stocks several sizes of screws: M3, 2-56,
8-32, and 1/4-20. We will use these as references for tolerancing.
Screws have a nominal specified diameter, but all screws are slightly
undersized to guarantee a fit into a threaded hole. The nominal
diameters are as follows:

=====================  ===================  ===================  ===================  ===================
  Thread               2-56                 8-32                 1/4-20               M3                  
  Nominal Diameter     0.086 inches         0.164 inches         0.250 inches         3.0 mm              
  Close Fit            0.089 inches         0.1695 inches        0.257 inches         3.15 mm             
  Free Fit             0.096 inches         0.177 inches         0.266 inches         3.30 mm
=====================  ===================  ===================  ===================  ===================

More of these parameters can be found
`here <http://www.engineershandbook.com/Tables/taphole.htm>`__ or
`here <http://www.littlemachineshop.com/reference/tapdrillsizes.pdf>`__.

For this experiment, we will focus on cutting smaller holes to see at
what point we can achieve an **interference fit**. Acrylic is relatively
brittle and not very conducive to tapping, but for light-duty
connections self-tapping with a normal screw can sometimes be enough to
secure a threaded fastener.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Obtain samples of each of the four screws listed in the table above;
   the length does not matter.
#. Obtain a set of digital calipers. We stock `Neiko 6-inch
   calipers <http://www.amazon.com/Neiko-01407A-Extra-Large-SAE-Metric-Conversion/dp/B000GSLKIW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402253100&sr=8-1&keywords=calipers>`__
   in the lab.
#. Measure and note the actual diameter of each screw.
#. Obtain several scraps of 3 mm acrylic at least 50 mm x 50 mm square.
#. Cut the plate with grid of holes found in
   ``laser_test_cutting_plan.dxf`` using the laser cutter. More detailed
   information and guides can be found `in the 16-223 course
   notes <http://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/physcomp/f15/16-223/guide/laser_cutter.html>`__.
   You may need to adjust the power settings and recut, as the laser
   power is not consistent over time as the mirrors get dirty. Be sure
   to punch the small scraps out of the holes fairly promptly before
   they possibly fuse back together with the part.
#. Cut two copies of the plate with notches and tabs found in
   ``laser_test_cutting_plan.dxf``.
#. Use the screws to probe each hole in the first example. Which holes
   are clearance, and which interfere? Can you observe the conical shape
   of the hole? Did every screw size work equally well? Did some not cut
   cleanly?
#. Can you confirm the diameter measurement using calipers? Can you
   compare the top and bottom openings? Precisely measuring the inside
   diameter of holes can be difficult with calipers; machine shops often
   stock calibrated `gauge
   pins <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_block#Gauge_pins>`__ for
   performing this type of inside diameter measurement.
#. If all the holes are too large, make a copy of the DXF file, adjust
   the hole sizes slightly smaller, and recut the part. For a one-time
   adjustment, you can accomplish this directly in the laser cutter
   control software. On the cluster MacBook Pros, Adobe Illustrator is
   sometimes the fastest tool for this; be sure to import and export the
   DXF at 1 unit:1 mm scale. We also recommend
   `DraftSight <https://www.3ds.com/products-services/draftsight-cad-software/>`__,
   a freely available 2D CAD tool.
#. Now examine one of the plates with notches and tabs. Measure the
   width and depth of the square notches and tabs; how close are they to
   the design size? How wide do you estimate is the kerf? How well do
   the square tabs of one copy fit into the square notches of the other?
#. Try fitting the wedge-shaped tabs into the square notches with the
   plates positioned at right angles. Can you find a position in which
   they fit tightly?

Comments
^^^^^^^^

If you want to create a box from laser-cut parts, a handy tool is the
`online BoxMaker tool <http://boxmaker.connectionlab.org/>`__. In the
examples below is an automatically generated design for a box with the
following parameters: 50x50x50 mm dimensions, 3 mm material thickness,
0.1 mm cut width. Note that the BoxMaker tool leaves a lot of extra
space between the panels which represents wasted material; it is a good
idea to move the parts closer or rearrangement them to fit your stock.

Some more elaborate examples of slot and tab structures can be found in
the
`physcomp-solidworks <https://github.com/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-solidworks>`__
repository; see ``wedge_examples`` in particular. Also, some examples of
joining plates for use with aluminum extrusion can be found in
``spokes_example``.
