Exercise: Electromechanical Oscillation
---------------------------------------

**Note: this is a new exercise, please provide feedback on errors and
clarity.**

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

Design and test a mechanical oscillator pumped via electrical actuation.

Overview
^^^^^^^^

Physical oscillators are at the core of many machines: clocks, timers,
motors, pumps, quartz crystals, washing cycles, musical instruments, and
on and on. Oscillations are a product of a physical process which cycles
through a set of states, with physical dynamics that determine the rate
of the process. Practical oscillators lose energy over time to friction
and need a source of power which delivers energy in phase to maintain
the oscillation energy.

A few examples follow:

#. A pendulum clock has a well-defined time constant based on the
   gravitational constant, the length of the pendulum, and (weakly) the
   magnitude of the motion. Energy is added via an *escapement*
   mechanism which applies force *in phase* with the pendulum swing. The
   force is provided from a descending weight which stores gravitational
   potential energy.
#. An electric motor has a *rotor* and *stator* with varying magnetic
   fields which repel each other, precisely timed to apply torque in
   phase with the rotation. In a small DC motor, the stator holds
   permanent magnets and the rotor has an electromagnet winding with
   current controlled by *commutation brushes* which mechanically switch
   the current direction as a function of angle. The motor lacks the
   single-frequency resonance of the pendulum; the rotational rate
   emerge as a function of the voltage, applied load, friction, and the
   intrinsic parameters.

Exercise Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creating and controlling a mechanical oscillation involves creating a
device which incorporates a physical dynamic process and adding
actuation to provide energy at the right time. The following exercise is
framed in abstract terms to allow for many possible outcomes. But keep
in mind that this can be very simple: a simple pendulum activated by
solenoid or motor is perfectly fine. And try to build as little as
possible: a pendulum device might comprise simply a solenoid and switch
taped to a board and wired together to a power supply to make a
'kicker', with a pendulum formed by a weight on the end of a string.

Steps and observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Choose a mechanical process which either cycles periodically or can
   be actuated to reset to an initial condition. Some ideas: swinging
   pendulum, 2D pendulum, ball rolling down track, mass rotating on a
   torsion spring, ball bouncing on plate, ball descending through
   liquid, water flowing between reservoirs.
#. Choose a relevant intermittent actuation which can add energy to the
   process. Some ideas: a solenoid kicker, a winch or arm to reset
   object position, pumps.
#. Choose a relevant state-based condition under which to activate the
   actuation. Some ideas: a particular object position, change of center
   of mass, liquid level. The key is that it is *not* based on time so
   that the natural time constant of the mechanical process will govern
   the oscillation rate.
#. Design and construct a simple mechanism to implement the oscillator.
   Basic electronics are preferred but microcontrollers are permissible
   as long as they are not serving as a time reference.
#. Test your mechanism. What is the frequency? Is it stable? Is is
   adjustable? How slow or fast can it go? Can it be dynamically
   modulated?
