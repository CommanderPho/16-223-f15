Day 3: Brainstorming
====================

Notes for 2015-09-09.  See also the :ref:`calendar`.

Notes from Day 2
----------------

   * Questions about breadboards.  Also, see :ref:`essential-skills-list`.
   * The meters can't read even register a red LED diode drop in diode test
     mode, but the diode function will work on a 1N914 or similar small diode
   * LEDs versus bulbs.
   * Many questions about lab notebook *reflections*.  Basically, keep it
     productive for both yourself and me.

   * Pacing: we will be on Unit 1 exercises until Sep 23, spanning roughly five
     class days; make sure your pace works for you.
