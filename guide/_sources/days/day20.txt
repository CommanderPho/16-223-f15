Day 20: Project 3 Prototype (Nov 9)
==========================================

Notes for 2015-11-09.  See also the :ref:`calendar`.

Notes from Day 19
------------------

#. I have returned your lab notebooks, they are sitting on the desk.  I
   apologize for taking so long.

#. In light of the fact that I am still calibrating the appropriate difficulty
   of the exercises, I am cancelling the Notebook 3 deadline.

#. Instead, you may optionally earn up to three extra points by exploring and
   writing up any three exercises of your choosing which you have not previously
   attempted.  However, you **must write up a reasonable reflection statement**
   and show a reasonable record of your investigation.  Several of you have
   received low notebook scores for not providing adequate documentation or
   insight.
