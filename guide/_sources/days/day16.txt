Day 16: Project 3 Introduction (Oct 26)
==========================================

Notes for 2015-10-26.  See also the :ref:`calendar`.

Notes from Day 15
------------------

#. Learn to use a tripod or Magic Arm.  Your video is of pretty limited use when
   only handheld.

#. Project 2 Peer Evaluation results.

Agenda
------

#. Assignments

   * Due today: Notebook 2.
   * Due Wednesday: Project 3 proposal.
   * Wednesday: brief in-class individual interviews.

#. In-class

   * Disassemble Project 2 and put components away, unless it is the basis for
     your Project 3 or you have approval to keep it intact.

   * Form your project 3 group.
     
     * If you have worked with the same partner twice, I would greatly prefer
       you change partners for Project 3.  If you have a compelling reason to
       stay with the same partner, please be prepared to provide a strong
       justification.

     * I still prefer working pairs but no solo teams.  We have an odd number of
       students, so there will necessarily be one group of three.
     
   * Start developing your project idea and preparing **sketches** and
     **drawings** and a **project schedule**.  Please be sure to identify the
     *hardest* elements and clearly identify an early proof-of-concept goal.
