Academic papers
---------------

If you have a specific area in mind, `Google Scholar
<https://scholar.google.com/>`__ is a convenient starting point for finding
research papers on a given topic.

The Carnegie Mellon Library offers free on-campus access to many `research
databases <http://www.library.cmu.edu/find/databases>`__ via the `unified search
interface <http://www.library.cmu.edu/>`__.  Many databases are full-text and
papers can be downloaded as PDF files.
