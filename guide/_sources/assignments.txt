Assignments
===========

For all assignments, please consult the :ref:`calendar` for precise due dates.
Please also become aware of the stringent requirements of the
:ref:`lateness-policy`.

.. _skills-survey:

Skills Survey
-------------

The first assignment is to complete a survey covering a wide range of skills and
experiences.  Please complete the following Google form: `Skill Survey Form`_

The results are also being collected for `60-223`_ for comparison.

.. _xsead-profile:

IDeATe Gallery Profile
----------------------

We strongly consider every student create an account on the `IDeATe project
gallery`_ and fill out profile information.  It will help us to know you better
and help you to discover your cohort via the `IDeATe profile index`_.

I recommend that you consider using a pseudonymous handle for your account.  The
system allows for either private or public postings; some students are more
comfortable posting work publicly if it won't be forever linked to their real
name.

Here is what you will need to answer during the profile interview:

#. username (real or pseudonymous)
#. real name (for internal use)
#. profile image (square is best)
#. one-paragraph biography (200 chars amx)
#. focus areas (IDeATe program area interests)
#. skills with which you identify (brief phrases)


Research Talk
-------------

Each student is required to give a five-minute research talk on a topic of their
choosing.  The short length is actually a challenge, it requires careful
attention to developing and practicing a clear delivery of a few key ideas.
This assignment provides practice in technical speaking and will serve to bring
additional ideas into our discussion.

The topic may be chosen in one of several ways:

#. Describe an existing project involving physical computing that was developed
   elsewhere.
#. Present a synopsis of a published research paper of interest to physical
   computing.
#. Research and teach a documented analytic or design technique (which must be
   new to you).

Please see :ref:`related-work` for starting points for finding sources to
research.

.. FIXME need specific prompts

Ideation Exercise 1
-------------------

The first ideation exercise is intended to generate and share an abundance of
potential project ideas related to physical computing.

#. Please consider all the themes we will be exploring through physical
   computing: human needs for expression, communication, life support, and
   pleasure; embodiment, measurement, time, signals, and algorithm; and the
   nature of processes which flow from physical to digital forms and back.

#. **Come up with fifty ideas for projects which address the themes above.**  When
   devising ideas, consider holding back your presumptions about what is or is
   not possible technically: at this stage we encourage broad, unbounded
   thinking.

#. **Bring your ideas to class on a physical printout following these rules**:
   
   * all ideas on a single 8.5" x 11" piece of paper
   * one line per idea
   * number the lines
   * leave a 2-inch margin on the left hand side

#. **Submit a PDF version** of your single page as a response to the Blackboard
   assignment.  **Only PDF will be accepted**: do not submit document files such
   as .doc.

The physical format is very important as we will be passing around and reviewing
idea lists at the start of class.  Some general heuristics for brainstorming
success can be found in the :ref:`ideation` resource section.  For inspiring
examples, see :ref:`related-work` for starting points.

.. _lab-exercises:

Lab Exercises and Lab Notebook
------------------------------

The lab exercises are intended to be performed by pairs of students.  The
exercises will be performed in the lab during class time, but also outside class
as needed. Each student should keep their own lab notebook as detailed above.

.. FIXME need to detail the notebook requirements

Anyone who completes the basic exercises should consider undertaking more of the
optional challenge activities listed at the end of most exercises.

.. _unit-1-exercises:

Unit 1 Exercises: Energy, Information, Transduction
---------------------------------------------------

The first unit has many exercises intended familiarize you with the lab and
basic electronic equipment and are essential for developing the vocabulary and
skills to fulfill the projects.

The initial exercises are intended to be quick, simple introductions,
but please be sure that each member of each student pair practices each
physical and measurement skill. Part of the exercise is absorbing a set
of technical terms; the meaning will become apparent in time through
immersion in practice.

The following is a suggested order which generally develops from simple to more
complex, however the sequence is not strict.  There are more exercises available
for this section than time so individuals may choose exercises according to the
experience and discretion.  If something is too elementary for your experience
level, please choose something new for you.  If an exercise requires a part
which is not available, please move on to something feasible.
  
Please be sure to read the :ref:`basic-circuits-guide` section for a review of
terminology and concepts.  Also, please skim the :ref:`errata` section if you
have trouble to identify mistakes in the text or general hints.

.. _project-report-requirements:

Project Reports
---------------

All projects require an accompanying report document in PDF format.  An outline
of specific prompt questions will be provided for each assignment, with a
denotation of specific required and optional elements.  The following specifies
the detailed formatting requirements for all reports.  The content itself should
generally follow the :ref:`project-report-template`.

#. All report documents must be submitted as PDF files.  Original document
   formats (.doc, Word, .tex, etc.) will be returned unread.

#. Report documents must be submitted within a single zip file which also
   contains the implementation supporting code and engineering files.

#. The zip file name must include a unique project identifier.  E.g. it should
   have a meaningful name ('talking-clock.zip') not a generic name
   ('project.zip').
   
#. Each group must submit one joint report.  If a group member fails to fulfill
   their documentation role, the other group members should submit what they can
   on time and ask for an extension with an explanation.

#. Each report should clearly attribute the contribution of each group member.
   Individual grades may be adjusted from group grades if it becomes apparent
   that contribution is not equitable.  A separate confidential peer evaluation
   may be requested individually from each group member at the instructor's
   discretion.

#. Reports must generally include a statement of objectives, general descriptive
   text, narrative, results, photos, technical documentation, and citations of
   related work.

#. Any project photos must be embedded within the PDF document, and provided at
   a print-ready resolution (e.g. 300dpi).

#. Project videos must be uploaded to the hosting service of your choice and an
   *active, clickable link* provided within the body of the PDF report.  Please
   check the documentation of your authoring software if you need help making
   your links active.

#. Project videos must adhere to the minimum and maximum duration limits,
   including titles and credits.

#. Project videos are encouraged to include a title and credits.

#. In general, enough technical documentation must be provided that a person of
   equal skill could replicate the construction of the project.

#. All program source code is required and must be provided within the single zip
   file.

#. Electronic schematics and fabrication diagrams must be provided in PDF form,
   either embedded in the main report or as a separate PDF.  Schematics must
   reflect the as-built state.  Schematics must use conventional symbols and
   notation.  Hand-drawn or illustrated schematics are acceptable, but the use
   of schematic capture software such as EAGLE is recommended as it will help
   reduce errors.  **Breadboard diagrams are not acceptable substitutes.**

#. Mechanical drawings or sketches must be provided in PDF form, either embedded
   in the main report or as a separate PDF.  Mechanical drawings must clearly
   specify the scale and units.

#. Any original CAD files are required.  Multi-file designs (typical for
   SolidWorks) must be provided within the single zip file.

#. Formatting and typography are at your discretion.  However, beautiful graphic
   design won't be rewarded, so please use your effort wisely.
