Project Reports
===============

All projects require an accompanying report document in **PDF** format.  An outline
of specific prompt questions will be provided for each assignment, with a
denotation of specific required and optional elements.  The following specifies
the detailed formatting requirements for all reports.  The content itself should
generally follow the :ref:`project-report-template`.

#. All report documents must be submitted as PDF files.  Original document
   formats (.doc, Word, .tex, etc.) will be returned unread.

#. Report documents must be submitted within a single zip file which also
   contains the implementation supporting code and engineering files.

#. The zip file name must include a unique project identifier.  E.g. it should
   have a meaningful name ('talking-clock.zip') not a generic name
   ('project.zip').
   
#. Each group must submit one joint report.  If a group member fails to fulfill
   their documentation role, the other group members should submit what they can
   on time and ask for an extension with an explanation.

#. Each report should clearly attribute the contribution of each group member.
   Individual grades may be adjusted from group grades if it becomes apparent
   that contribution is not equitable.  A separate confidential peer evaluation
   may be requested individually from each group member at the instructor's
   discretion.

#. Reports must generally include a statement of objectives, general descriptive
   text, narrative, results, photos, technical documentation, and citations of
   related work.

#. Any project photos must be embedded within the PDF document, and provided at
   a print-ready resolution (e.g. 300dpi).

#. Project videos must be uploaded to the hosting service of your choice and an
   *active, clickable link* provided within the body of the PDF report.  Please
   check the documentation of your authoring software if you need help making
   your links active.

#. Project videos must adhere to the minimum and maximum duration limits,
   including titles and credits.

#. Project videos are encouraged to include a title and credits.

#. In general, enough technical documentation must be provided that a person of
   equal skill could replicate the construction of the project.

#. All program source code is required and must be provided within the single zip
   file.

#. Electronic schematics and fabrication diagrams must be provided in PDF form,
   either embedded in the main report or as a separate PDF.  Schematics must
   reflect the as-built state.  Schematics must use conventional symbols and
   notation.  Hand-drawn or illustrated schematics are acceptable, but the use
   of schematic capture software such as EAGLE is recommended as it will help
   reduce errors.  **Breadboard diagrams are not acceptable substitutes.**

#. Mechanical drawings or sketches must be provided in PDF form, either embedded
   in the main report or as a separate PDF.  Mechanical drawings must clearly
   specify the scale and units.

#. Any original CAD files are required.  Multi-file designs (typical for
   SolidWorks) must be provided within the single zip file.

#. Formatting and typography are at your discretion.  However, beautiful graphic
   design won't be rewarded, so please use your effort wisely.
