Topic Summary
*************
	     
This is a fast-paced course and you will be expected to learn many new skills
independently and teach them to each other. Please see the
:ref:`learning-objectives` section for a detailed discussion of learning
approach and the :ref:`calendar` for the schedule.

   
Unit 1: Energy, Information, Transduction
=========================================

The purpose of this unit is to introduce a fundamental understanding of the
energy and information transfer processes which connect the physical world with
computational processes.  Along the way, we will rapidly bring every student up
to speed with basic electronics, mechanisms, and programming through a series of
lab exercises and a small collaborative project.

All exercises and projects will be performed in pairs or
groups, which we will be changing frequently to develop your abilities to take
on different roles in collaboration.  

The overall goals for each student include the following:

#. clarify individual skills and learning objectives
#. get to know and respect the lab
#. get to know what physical computing is and where you see it
#. practice effective collaboration
#. understand how to identify system boundaries
#. understand the basics of physical signal processing
#. understand how to build basic interface circuits for both input and output
#. learn many practical lab skills
#. learn to use an Arduino
#. understand basic techniques for building signal-processing programs in Arduino C++
   

Unit 2: Signals, Time, and Dynamics
===================================

The purpose of this unit is to explore the role of *time* in processes which
span physical, electrical, and computational domains.  

The overall goals include the following:

#. be able to identify characteristic time scales for the physical, electronic,
   computational, and human processes we use
#. understand the basic concepts of time-domain sampling
#. learn the meaning of *sampling rate*, *jitter*, and *Nyquist frequency*
#. understand the physical nature of sound as pressure oscillations
#. understand the basics of time-slice computation for simulating simultaneous
   processes
#. be able to create rhythmic patterns using computational means   
#. understand basic concepts of feedback
#. observe how physical dynamics can complement computational processes

   
Unit 3: Algorithms and State
============================

The purpose of this unit is to explore the broader meaning of *state*, including
the essentials of finite-state machines and processes with memory.  This is an
idea with both physical and computational meaning.


Final Project
=============

The final month of the semester will focus entirely on group projects to further
develop and demonstrate understanding of the technical material.
