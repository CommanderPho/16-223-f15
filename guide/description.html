<h1>1.1. Course Description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Physical computing refers to the design and construction of physical systems
that use a mix of software and hardware to sense and respond to the surrounding
world.  Such systems blend digital and physical processes into toys and gadgets,
kinetic sculpture, functional sensing and assessment tools, mobile instruments,
interactive wearables, and more.  This is a project-based course that deals with
all aspects of conceiving, designing and developing projects with physical
computing: the application, the artifact, the computer-aided design environment,
and the physical prototyping facilities.  The course is organized around a
series of practical hands-on exercises which introduce the fundamentals of
circuits, embedded programming, sensor signal processing, simple mechanisms,
actuation, and time-based behavior.  The key objective is gaining an intuitive
understanding of how information and energy move between the physical,
electronic, and computational domains to create a desired behavior.  The
exercises provide building blocks for collaborative projects which utilize the
essential skills and challenge students to not only consider how to make things,
but also for whom we design, and why the making is worthwhile.</p>

<h1>1.2. Course Sections<a class="headerlink" href="#course-sections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Introduction to Physical Computing is offered in two sections.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The 16-223 section trains students with a focus in art, design, performance,
or business to approach physical computing as a study of <em>systems theory</em>
expressed through the development of practical prototypes.  The goal is an
intuitive high-level understanding of the analysis of energetic and
informational processes which span the physical, electronic, and algorithmic
domains.  The informal subtitle of the course is <em>&#8220;How to think like an
engineer&#8221;</em> since many of the lessons are embedded in the thought processes
of engineering: consideration of interfaces, boundaries, abstractions,
representation, and systematic approaches to diagnosis.  This is intended to
provide analytic intellectual tools to complement and extend their academic
experience in conceptualization and narrative, while also teaching a host of
practical techniques for successfully executing project ideas.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="http://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/physcomp/f15/60-223">60-223</a> section trains students with a focus in computer science and
engineering to approach physical computing from an art and design
perspective.  The goal is to helps students develop a culturally expansive,
inclusive and critical perspective to projects, products and services that
bring computation into the physical world.  Since the students have a
technical academic focus outside of IDEATE, this section offers
complementary experiences that characterize training in the arts, design,
architecture and drama: self-directed learning, critical making, performance
and storytelling, discussion and critique. (Quoted from the <a class="reference external" href="http://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/physcomp/f15/60-223/syllabus/">60-223
Syllabus</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="learning-objectives">
<span id="id2"></span><h1>1.3. Learning Objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-objectives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Upon completion of this course the students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>participate in collaborative teams by negotiating common goals and coordinating roles</li>
<li>communicate with technical collaborators using precise language</li>
<li>approach complex physical computing problems with a systematic overview that integrates iterative research and design steps</li>
<li>evaluate systems in the context of an end user application or experience</li>
<li>work in a mixed physical-digital environment and laboratory</li>
<li>make effective use of standard hardware and software tools for physical computing</li>
<li>generate systems specifications from a perceived need</li>
<li>partition functionality between hardware and software</li>
<li>produce interface specifications for a system composed of numerous subsystems</li>
<li>use computer-aided development tools for design, fabrication and testing and debugging</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="teaching-philosophy">
<h2>1.3.1. Teaching Philosophy<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course is as much an introduction to the IDeATe Physical Computing Program
as to the technology.  It operates under the following principles:</p>
<p><strong>Immersion</strong>.  Language shapes thought; thinking clearly about engineering and
computing requires precise use of language.  The course emphasizes correct use
of technical terminology from the start, even as the meaning incrementally
becomes understood.</p>
<p><strong>Experiential Learning</strong>.  We learn by doing.  The course emphasizes immediate
application of theory into practical demonstration; it is the success and
especially the failure of the experiment which creates a vivid understanding of
the principles.</p>
<p><strong>Cooperative Learning</strong>.  We teach each other.  Articulating an explanation
develops and tests knowledge and hones the skill of knowing the bounds of one&#8217;s
own knowledge.  Sometimes we will teach each other incorrectly, but careful
attention to further evidence will correct this over time.</p>
<p><strong>Self-motivation</strong>. Students are responsible for their own progress.  Wherever
possible, the driving motivation will be a self-chosen goal, divided into
manageable subproblems.  The desire for the goal prompts autonomous exploration.
If you ever find the course dull, that is an opportunity to reflect on what you
are trying to achieve and choose a new objective.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection and Writing</strong>.  Understanding develops through reflection, and the
best discipline for reflection is writing and drawing.  Mere repetition of the
examples does not build skill; it is the process of reflection which integrates
experience into knowledge which can be applied to novel situations.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong>.  The aim of IDeATe is to train each student to be excellent
in one area of technology or arts and be able to collaborate within diverse
cohorts of technology and arts experts.  Collaborative skill requires excellence
in one&#8217;s own areas of expertise, an ability to translate ideas across
disciplinary bounds, and a proficiency in negotiation and compromise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="essential-skills">
<h2>1.3.2. Essential Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#essential-skills" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The activities, exercises and graded projects in this course address a
wide range of essential skills for the domain of physical computing.
They are life skills, not evaluated demonstrations.</p>
<p>The most important essential skill is the ability to learn new skills
independently and to teach them to others. The course website offers a
set of online references as a starting point to acquiring the essential
skills.  These references are provided only as a starting point:
throughout the course of the semester, students are expected to build
upon these references by finding more references, finding better
references, and creating their own video and photo teaching material.</p>
<p>For a detailed list of essential skills, please see the <a class="reference internal" href="skills.html#essential-skills-list"><span>Essential Skills List</span></a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://physcomp.org/category/essential-skills/">the essential skills posts on the F14 course web site</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="group-work">
<span id="group-roles"></span><h2>1.3.3. Group Work<a class="headerlink" href="#group-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course relies on group work and group learning.  Throughout the course,
students will work in pairs or groups that are either random, assigned, and
self-selecting.  Randomly selected groups are intended to give students practice
with teamwork among unfamiliar collaborators, a common setting in the real
world.</p>
<p>Members of small teams may have either fixed or fluid roles as long as each
project responsibility is clearly assigned to a team member.  The purpose of
naming a role is defining a set of responsibilities for an individual to assume.
When assuming a role, we expect each individual to fully assume the
responsibilities of their selected role(s) for the project.  Students are
expected to reflect on their own successes and failures within each role and to
develop a better understanding of how their own behavior can affect group
dynamics and how group dynamics affect the development of a project.</p>
<p>We encourage experimentation with individual roles within each group.  Each
student is expected to occupy diverse roles over the course of the semester both
within and outside their expertise.  Some suggested roles include the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Integrator: lead the overall development of the project. Responsibilities
include leading the negotiation of a common objective, negotiating assigned
roles and expectations for other group members, facilitating communication
among group members, setting and maintaining and overall timeline for the
project’s execution, and researching existing relevant work.</li>
<li>Developer: lead the design and fabrication of an aspect of the
project. Responsibilities include researching relevant existing solutions,
developing concepts which meet the objectives, producing sketches and diagrams
to refine the implementation plan, and determining and executing fabrication
strategies.</li>
<li>Iterator: lead the testing and redesign of an aspect of the project.
Responsibilities include evaluating prototypes against the agreed objectives,
finding solutions to problems, and modifying or refabricating as appropriate.</li>
<li>Scribe: document the project with photos, videos, and writing.
Responsibilities include documenting the development process as well as the
final outcome, and creating a well formatted document with text, images, and
video describing the project’s goals, methodologies and results.</li>
<li>Tutor: teach specific techniques or knowledge to teammates.  This role is
natural for students with advanced knowledge or experience with the activity
who will gain the most by teaching and helping others instead of breezing
through familiar territory. Responsibilities include assuring that all group
members gain the necessary essential skills required for the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>A person may flow naturally from one role to the next as projects are subdivided
into subgoals, as long as an individual clearly takes responsibility for each
element.  Note that the role of scribe is often best universally shared so that
each person is continually documenting their own process, and then collaborating
on final documentation at the end.</p>
