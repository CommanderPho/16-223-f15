    <h2>Exercise: Laser Cutting Features and Tolerances</h2>

    <p><b>Note: this is a new exercise, please  provide feedback on errors and clarity.</b></p>
    
    <h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Understand basic design considerations for laser-cut acrylic parts.
      Learn to operate the laser cutter, measure features, and choose design
      elements compatible with laser-cutting in acrylic.</p>

    <h4>Process Overview</h4>
    
    <p>Laser cutters are extremely useful tools for cutting complex 2D forms.
      Their best feature for our coursework is the speed with which an idea can
      be tested: it is possible to conceive of a part, create a 2D drawing,
      output a DXF, and cut material to make a functional part
      within <i>minutes</i>.</p>

    <p>Laser cutters are intrinsically two-dimensional tools: a focused beam of
      infrared laser light (e.g. invisible to the human eye) moves on a XY
      gantry under computer control to trace out curves and lines.  The beam is
      turned on and off to start and end lines during cutting.  It may also be
      used in a raster engraving mode in which it sweeps an area while
      modulating the beam power very quickly to vary the cut and create an image
      on the surface.</p>

    <p>The fundamental cutting process is <b>melting</b> or <b>burning</b> from
      the heat resulting from absorbing the energy of the light.  An air jet
      blows downwards into the cut area to help move melted material out of the
      cut before it resolidifies.  The cutter bed can be moved up or down prior
      to cutting to place the top plane of the flat material at the focal point
      of the laser.</p>

    <h4>Design Overview</h4>    

    <p>The cut file specifies the centerline for the laser path, but the width
      of the <b>kerf</b> means that material will be cut on either side of the
      beam path.  So an inside edge such as a hole will have a
      slightly <b>larger</b> diameter than drawn and an outside edge will have a
      slightly <b>smaller</b> width or diameter than drawn.  Any hole will 
      be slightly <b>conical</b> since the cuts are slightly tapered top to
      bottom.<p>

    <p>The idea
      of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance">engineering
	tolerance</a> has several different meaning in practice related to
      choosing design parameters which can accommodate physical variations.  For
      mass-produced parts, the variation can include dimensional imprecision
      from part to part.  For parts subject to environmental changes, the
      variation might be changes in dimension or material properties resulting
      from thermal or humidity changes.  A robust design will include features
      and parameter choices which can accommodate these variations to an
      acceptable level.</p>
    
    <p>The laser-cutting process has several sources of variation: the cutter
      itself changes calibration as the optics are dirtied and the laser ages,
      the focal depth can be miscalibrated from pass to pass, the material
      does not always have an exact thickness, and the XY drive mechanism has
      backlash and positioning error.</p>

    <h4>Tolerant Design Strategies</h4>

    <p><b>Handwork</b>.  If parts are always cut slightly undersize, they can be
      hand-filed and trimmed to fit.  This is labor-intensive and consistency is
      difficult, although for a very simple part sometimes the fastest
      solution.</p>
    
    <p><b>Iterative Adjustment</b>. The part design can be adapted to the
      current process parameters by measuring a cut part and adjusting the
      design file.  This can be time-consuming to iterate and is not
      necessarily stable in the face of day-to-day variations.  It can however
      lead to very precise parts, cut within the intrinsic mechanical
      precision of the cutter.</p>

    <p><b>Tolerant Design</b>.  The part can be designed to allow process
      variation and still retain function.  This eliminates handwork at the cost
      of more careful design.  However, it may also require reduced part
      precision.  Techniques include: using tapered features, using fasteners,
      adding extra alignment features, carefully choosing structural
      topology./<p>

      <h4>Exercise Details</h4>

      
    <p>For this exercise, we are providing sample laser-cuttable parts to
    demonstrate a few techniques for building reliable structures out of
    acrylic.  These are intended as starting points for your own designs. The
    sources for these designs can be found in
    the <a href="https://github.com/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-solidworks">physcomp-solidworks</a>
    git repository on github.</p>
      
    <p>The Physical Computing Lab stocks several sizes of screws: M3, 2-56,
      8-32, and 1/4-20.  We will use these as references for tolerancing.  Screws
    have a nominal specified diameter, but all screws are slightly undersized
      to guarantee a fit into a threaded hole.  The nominal diameters are as
      follows:</p>

    <!-- see pages 1715,1900 of Machinery's Handbook 26th Edition-->
    
    <p><table style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 0.5in;">
      <tr><th>Thread</th>	<th>Nominal Diameter</th><th>Close Fit</th>	<th>Free Fit</th></tr>
      <tr><td>2-56</td>		<td>0.086 inches</td>	<td>0.089 inches</td>	<td>0.096 inches</td></tr>
      <tr><td>8-32</td>		<td>0.164 inches</td>	<td>0.1695 inches</td>	<td>0.177 inches</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1/4-20</td>	<td>0.250 inches</td>	<td>0.257 inches</td>	<td>0.266 inches</td></tr>
      <tr><td>M3</td>		<td>3.0 mm</td>		<td>3.15 mm</td>	<td>3.30 mm</td></tr>
    </table></p>

    <p>More of these parameters can be
    found <a href="http://www.engineershandbook.com/Tables/taphole.htm">here</a>
    or <a href="http://www.littlemachineshop.com/reference/tapdrillsizes.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <p>For this experiment, we will focus on cutting smaller holes to see at
      what point we can achieve an <b>interference fit</b>.  Acrylic is
      relatively brittle and not very conducive to tapping, but for light-duty
      connections self-tapping with a normal screw can sometimes be enough to
      secure a threaded fastener.</p>
    
    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Obtain samples of each of the four screws listed in the table above;
      the length does not matter.</li>

      <li>Obtain a set of digital calipers.  We stock <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Neiko-01407A-Extra-Large-SAE-Metric-Conversion/dp/B000GSLKIW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402253100&sr=8-1&keywords=calipers">Neiko 6-inch calipers</a> in the lab.</li>

      <li>Measure and note the actual diameter of each screw.</li>

      <li>Obtain several scraps of 3mm acrylic at least 50mm x 50mm.</li>

      <li>Cut the plate with grid of holes found in laser_test_cutting_plan.dxf
	using the laser cutter.  More detailed information and guides can be
	found <a href="http://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/physcomp/f15/16-223/guide/laser_cutter.html">in
	the 16-223 course notes.</a></li>

      <li>Cut two copies of the plate with notches and tabs found in
      laser_test_cutting_plan.dxf.</li>
      
      <li>Use the screws to probe each hole in the first example.  Which holes
	are clearance, and which interfere? Can you observe the conical shape of
	the hole?  Did every screw size work equally well?  Did some not cut
	cleanly?</li>

      <li>Can you confirm the diameter measurement using calipers? Can you
	compare the top and bottom openings? Precisely measuring the inside
	diameter of holes can be difficult with calipers; machine shops often
	stock
	calibrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_block#Gauge_pins">gauge
	pins</a> for performing this type of inside diameter measurement.</li>

      <li>If all the holes are too large, make a copy of the DXF file, adjust
	the hole sizes slightly smaller, and recut the part.  For a one-time
	adjustment, you can accomplish this directly in the laser cutter control
	software.  On the cluster MacBook Pros, Adobe Illustrator is sometimes
	the fastest tool for this; be sure to import and export the DXF at
	1&nbsp;unit:1&nbsp;mm scale.  We also
	recommend <a href="https://www.3ds.com/products-services/draftsight-cad-software/">DraftSight</a>,
	a freely available 2D CAD tool.</li>

      <li>Now examine one of the plates with notches and tabs.  Measure the
	width and depth of the square notches and tabs; how close are they to
	the design size?  How wide do you estimate is the kerf?  How well do the
	square tabs of one copy fit into the square notches of the other?</li>

      <li>Try fitting the wedge-shaped tabs into the square notches with the
	plates positioned at right angles.  Can you find a position in which
	they fit tightly?</li>
    </ol>      

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>If you want to create a box from laser-cut parts, a handy tool is
    the <a href="http://boxmaker.connectionlab.org/">online BoxMaker
    tool</a>. In the examples below is an automatically generated design for a
    box with the following parameters: 50x50x50 mm dimensions, 3mm material
      thickness, 0.1mm cut width.</p>

    <p>Some more elaborate examples of slot and tab structures can be found in the
      <a href="https://github.com/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-solidworks">physcomp-solidworks</a>
      repository; see <tt>wedge_examples</tt> in particular.  Also, some
      examples of joining plates for use with aluminum extrusion can be found
      in <tt>spokes_example</tt>.</p>
