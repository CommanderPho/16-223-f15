    <h2>Exercise: Electromechanical Oscillation</h2>

    <p><b>Note: this is a new exercise, please  provide feedback on errors and clarity.</b></p>

    <h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Design and test a mechanical oscillator pumped via electrical actuation.</p>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>Mechanical oscillators are at the core of...</p>

    <h4>Exercise Details</h4>

    <p></p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Choose a mechanical process which either cycles periodically or can be
	actuated to reset to an initial condition.  Some ideas: swinging
	pendulum, 2D pendulum, ball rolling down track, mass rotating on a
	torsion spring, ball bouncing on plate, ball descending through liquid,
	water flowing between reservoirs.</li>

      <li>Choose a relevant intermittent actuation which can add energy to the
	process. Some ideas: a solenoid kicker, a winch or arm to reset object
	position, pumps.</li>

      <li>Choose a relevant state-based condition under which to activate the
	actuation.  Some ideas: a particular object position, change of center
	of mass, liquid level.  The key is that it is <i>not</i> based on time
	so that the natural time constant of the mechanical process will govern
	the oscillation rate.</li>

      <li>Design and construct a simple mechanism to implement the oscillator.
	Basic electronics are preferred but microcontrollers are permissible as
	long as they are not serving as a time reference.</li>

      <li>Test your mechanism.  What is the frequency? Is it stable? Is is
	adjustable?  How slow or fast can it go?  Can it be dynamically
	modulated?</li>
    </ol>
