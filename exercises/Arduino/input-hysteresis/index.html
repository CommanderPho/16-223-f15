    <h2>Exercise: Input Hysteresis</h2>

    <p><b>Note: this is a new exercise, please provide feedback on errors and clarity.</b></p>
    
    <h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Understand the application of a single state variable to
      produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis"><i>hysteresis</i></a>,
      the time-based dependence of a system's output on present <b>and past</b>
      inputs.</p>

    <p>Hysteresis arises in a process when internal state causes the output
      response to vary based on the history of the input.  It can be a useful
      property to engineer into systems involving thresholds in order to avoid
      unwanted ambiguous behavior.  For example, a thermostat typically turns on
      when the temperature drops somewhat below the target and keeps the furnace
      running until the temperature is somewhat above the target.  This keeps
      the furnace from cycling on and off too rapidly.</p>

    <p>However, the phenomenon can also interfere with control of mechanical
      systems.  Most mechanical transmissions exhibit some degree
      of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_%28engineering%29"><i>backlash</i></a>,
      e.g. the slight gap between gear teeth, for which changing the direction
      of torque causes the contact to be lost and zero torque to be transmitted
      for a short displacement until load contact is re-established.  The extra
      state variable is the relative position of the parts, which are ideally
      intended to have a fixed relationship.  This can lead to motor chatter
      when trying to control an exact position with both positive and negative
      torques.</p>

    <p>This example presents a simple light-responsive system which incorporates
      hysteresis.  This might be a model for the behavior of a light-sensitive
      streetlight to allow it to turn off at dusk without oscillating in
      response to its own illumination.</p>

    <h4>State Transition Graph</h4>

    <p>This graph represents a set of discrete states modelled by the system.
      States are illustrated as ovals and transitions as arrows.  Each state can
      have an associated output, in this case the LED.  Transitions between
      states are defined by condition rules.  There is no representation of time
      in this graph; transitions are assumed to trigger instantaneously.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Set up an Arduino UNO with a photoresistor between +5V and A0 and a
	4.7K resistor between A0 and GND, e.g. a basic voltage divider to sense
	a varying light level using A0.  Check with a DMM that the A0 voltage
	varies over a wide range with changes in light level.  You may need to
	choose a different fixed resistor depending on your specific
	photoresistor.</li>

      <li>Upload the InputHysteresis program found in this folder.</li>

      <li>Open the Serial Console and set to 115200 baud.</li>

      <li>Observe the console messages and the onboard LED.  Can you observe the
	correct shadow and light levels to transition from off to on and back
	again?  If it fails to transition, check that the A0 voltage is varying
	widely enough; you may need to adjust the values for light_threshold and
	dark_threshold.</li>

      <li>Compare the code against the state transition diagram shown above.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>You may now recognize that the switch debouncing code introduced much
      earlier is a specific case of a finite-state machine implementing
      time-based hysteresis.</p>

    <h4>Optional Challenge</h4>

    <p>Can you introduce time measurements into the state graph?  Adding
      intermediate wait states conditioned on elapsed time would be another way to
      improve the hysteresis.</p>
