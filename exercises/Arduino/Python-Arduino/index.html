    <h2>Exercise: Python and Arduino</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Communicate data between Python and an Arduino using the USB serial bus.</p>

    <p>The Arduino IDE and Python solve different problems well.  The Arduino
      has easy direct access to its hardware interface, and can create and
      respond to electrical signals with very low latency.  Python is
      well-suited to interactive programming, but the latency is considerable
      higher than on a microcontroller, and on a laptop lacks access to hardware
      interfaces.  This exercise will demonstrate one way of coordinating Python
      and the Arduino to take advantage of the best features of each by linking
      them using a simple ASCII message protocol over the USB serial bus.</p>

    <p>The serial communication does introduce significant latency between the
      Arduino and Python so this approach is strongest for systems in which
      Python is used for tasks such as the GUI, visual display, sequencing, and
      overall event control.  It would not be suitable for high-bandwidth tasks
      such as cycling individual digital outputs to create a stepper motor
      waveform.  However, the extensibility of the protocol means that you can
      add those low-level hardware behaviors to the Arduino server program and
      invoke them via messages.</p>

    <p>Setting up the exercise requires a couple of preparatory steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Compiling and loading the OneInOneOutASCII Arduino sketch onto an Arduino Uno.</li>
      <li>Determining the exact name of the serial port offered by the Arduino over USB.</li>
      <li>Running the OneInOneOutGUI module in Python on a laptop.</li>
      <li>Verifying or setting the serial port name in the interface.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The OneInOneOutASCII sketch is provided in the course distribution in the
      folder named <code>support/Arduino/OneInOneOutASCII</code>.  If you have not cloned the
      course materials from github, you
      can <a href="http://cmuphyscomp.github.io/physcomp-examples/support/Arduino/OneInOneOutASCII/OneInOneOutASCII.ino">download
      it directly from github</a>.  The source code of the sketch provides
      details of the messaging scheme</p>

    <p>The Python patch is also available in the course distribution in the
      folder named <code>support/Python/OneInOneOutGUI</code>.  This also
      requires the supporting library from <code>support/Python/ArduinoGUI</code>.
      Because of the number of files involved, it is <b>highly recommended</b>
      that you clone the github repository to download them to your laptop.</p>

    <p>N.B. the cluster laptops include a MacPorts installation of Python which
      already includes the following required libraries: py27-numpy, py27-pyqt4,
      py27-pyqwt, and py27-serial.</p>

    </p><h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Upload the OneInOneOutASCII sketch onto an Arduino Uno.  </li>

      <li>Open the Serial Monitor, set the baud rate to 115200 and the line
	ending to Newline.  You should see data messages start to stream
	by.</li>

      <li>Enter 'poll 1000' in the input box and press enter.  The message rate should slow.</li>
      <li>Enter 'led 0' in the input box and press enter.  The LED marked L should go off.</li>
      <li>Enter 'led 1' in the input box and press enter.  The LED marked L should go on again.</li>
      <li>Note the exact serial port name from the Tools/Port menu in the Arduino IDE.</li>
      <li>Exit the Arduino IDE.</li>

      <li>The easiest way to run the Python GUI client from OS&nbsp;X is to
	double-click on the <code>run_gui.command</code> script found within the
	OneInOneOutGUI folder. However, in the long run it is more versatile to
	run it from the command line (or necessary if you are using Windows or a
	Raspberry Pi).  If you are using a cluster Mac the command
	is <code>python2.7 run_gui.py</code>.  This will use our MacPorts
	installation of Python which includes the required libraries instead of
	the system-provided Python.  On a Raspberry Pi use <code>python
	run_gui.py</code>.  On Windows the exact command will depend on which
	Python distribution you are using.</li>

      <li>Near the bottom of the panel is a text field labeled Arduino Port.  If
	that doesn't match the name of the serial device you noted before,
	please correct it.  Then toggle the Connected button to open the Arduino
	serial port.  If you toggle the Show Raw Data button, you should see a
	stream of messages in the text area similar to those you saw before from
	the Arduino IDE.</li>

      <li>Try the LED On and LED Off buttons and observe the Arduino LED.  On
	each press you should also see the RX LED flash briefly as the message
	is received on the Arduino.</li>

      <li>The plot at the top labeled ArduinoScope shows the stream of readings
	from the A0 analog input.  If the input is disconnected, this will just
	be electrical noise.  Try touching the A0 pin from the back of the
	Arduino board; you should see a change in the plot from the electrical
	noise conducted by your skin.
      </li>

      <li>The Command Input text field allows manually sending commands much as
      you did with the Arduino IDE.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>This particular Arduino IDE sketch is going to serve as the basis for all
      the following exercises in which we connect hardware to the Arduino and
      control it from Python.</p>

    <p>For a challenge, examine the source code for both the sketch and the
      GUI and work out how to add additional message types.</p>
